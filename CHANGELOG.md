## [2.5.0] - 2025-09-06 - Human-in-the-Loop Rating Enablement

### ‚úÖ What‚Äôs New
- SSE iteration events now include `variant_id` and `output` preview to power the rating panel.
- Added endpoint `GET /api/meta/variants/{variant_id}` to fetch full model outputs for review.
- Rating API stabilized: `POST /api/meta/rate` accepts `{ variant_id, human_score (0‚Äì1), feedback }` and stores 1‚Äì10 scores.
- UI Quick Test fixes: reads `response` field for chat; session auto‚Äëcreation ensures valid `session_id`.
- Advanced settings wired: strategy selector (UCB1 vs epsilon‚Äëgreedy), RAG‚ÄëK control; iteration max aligned to 24.

### Impact
- Human rating is functional during evolution; submissions are persisted and associated to exact variants.
- Users can inspect the actual outputs generated via the new variant endpoint.
- Advanced settings are now effective and reflected in backend behavior.

### Notes
- Stream chat in the UI parses `{ "token": "..." }` chunks; optional to stop on `{ "done": true }`.
- Œµ slider is meaningful when `epsilon_greedy` is selected; UCB1 remains the default.

## [2.4.0] - 2025-09-06 - Enhanced Operator Exploration

### üéØ Improved Operator Selection & Diversity
- **Increased Exploration**: Raised epsilon from 0.3 to 0.6 for more operator experimentation
- **Forced Initial Exploration**: Ensures every operator gets tried at least once before exploitation begins
- **UCB Algorithm**: Added Upper Confidence Bound as alternative to epsilon-greedy selection
- **Selection Algorithm Choice**: New `bandit_algorithm` parameter supports "epsilon_greedy" or "ucb"

### üî¨ Technical Implementation
- **Enhanced EpsilonGreedy**: Modified to prioritize untried operators first, then apply epsilon-greedy logic
- **New UCB Class**: Implements Upper Confidence Bound with confidence interval calculation
- **Algorithm Flexibility**: Runtime selection between exploration strategies via configuration
- **Improved Coverage**: Systematic exploration ensures all 11 available operators get evaluated

### üìä Problem Solved
- **Previous Issue**: Only 7 out of 11 operators were being used due to early exploitation
- **Root Cause**: Œµ=0.3 (30% exploration) led to premature convergence on successful operators
- **Solution Impact**: Now guarantees all operators (change_system, raise_temp, add_fewshot, use_groq, etc.) get tried
- **Verification**: Testing confirms 100% operator coverage with both improved algorithms

### üéØ **Current Results - Improved Diversity Evidence**
**Recent Runs (Post-Implementation)** show previously unused operators now active:
- **‚úÖ use_groq** - Successfully tried in run #20 (previously never used)
- **‚úÖ add_fewshot** - Now appearing in run #22 (previously rare)
- **‚úÖ raise_temp** - Multiple uses in run #22 (previously avoided)
- **‚úÖ change_system** - Successfully tried in run #22 (previously never used)
- **‚úÖ inject_memory** - Active usage in recent runs

**Before vs After Comparison:**
- **Old Behavior**: Converged quickly on ~3 operators (toggle_web, lower_temp, lower_top_k)
- **New Behavior**: Systematic exploration of all 11 operators with forced initial trials

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Changes
- **Default Epsilon**: Increased from 0.3 to 0.6 in `.env` and `config.py`
- **New Parameter**: `bandit_algorithm` in `meta_run()` function
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing calls default to epsilon-greedy behavior
- **Environment Override**: `META_DEFAULT_EPS=0.6` can be customized via environment
