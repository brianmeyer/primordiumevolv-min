  "output_preview": "<think>\nOkay, let me tackle this problem. The user wants a simple script that automates data cleanup and summarizes results in a table. They also specified to provide step-by-step reasoning. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out what data cleanup means here. Since they didn't specify the data source, I'll assume it's a CSV file. Common data cleanup steps include handling missing values, removing duplicates, standardizing formats, etc. But the user said \"simple,\" so I'll pick a few key steps.\n\nMaybe the data has some missing values and duplicates. Let me think: step 1 would be reading the CSV. Using pandas is a good choice because it's standard for data manipulation in Python. \n\nStep 2: Handle missing values. For example, filling missing values with the mean for numeric columns or mode for categorical. But to keep it simple, maybe just drop rows with missing values? Wait, the user said \"summarizes results in a table,\" so they probably want the cleaned data summarized, not the raw data. \n\nWait, the problem says \"summarizes results in a table.\" So maybe after cleaning, the script should output a summary table. Like a count of rows, columns, maybe some stats.\n\nWait, the user might mean that the script cleans the data and then produces a summary table. For example, if the input data has duplicates or missing values, clean it, then show a summary.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Read the CSV file.\n2. Clean the data: handle missing values (e.g., dropna), remove duplicates.\n3. Generate a summary table (like count of rows, columns, maybe some key stats).\n\nBut the user said \"summarizes results,\" so maybe the summary is of the cleaned data. Like a table showing how many records were cleaned.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the summary is a table of the cleaned data's statistics. But the user said \"summarizes results,\" so perhaps a table of the cleaned data's basic stats.\n\nWait, the problem says \"automates data cleanup and summarizes results in a table.\" So the output should be a table summarizing the cleaned data.\n\nLet me try to write the script.\n\nFirst, import pandas.\n\nThen, read the CSV. Let's say the file is 'data.csv'.\n\nThen, clean: drop duplicates, handle missing values.\n\nFor example:\n\ndf = pd.read_csv('data.csv')\n\ndf_clean = df.drop_duplicates().dropna()\n\nThen, create a summary table. Maybe the user wants a table that shows the number of rows before and after cleaning, and maybe some stats.\n\nBut the problem says \"summarizes results in a a table\". So perhaps the output is a table with columns like 'Metric' and 'Value', where metrics are 'Rows before', 'Rows after', 'Columns', etc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the summary is a table of the cleaned data's statistics, like mean, median, etc.\n\nBut since the user said \"simple,\" I'll go with a basic summary table.\n\nLet me draft the script.\n\nStep-by-step:\n\n1. Import pandas.\n2. Read the CSV.\n3. Drop duplicates.\n4. Drop missing values.\n5. Calculate summary statistics (e.g., count of rows, columns).\n6. Print the summary as a table.\n\nWait, but the user might want the summary in a table format. In Python, using pandas' DataFrame to display.\n\nWait, the problem says \"summarizes results in a table\". So the output of the script should be a table, not a CSV. But the user didn't specify the output format. However, since they want a script, it's probably printing a table.\n\nLet me think of the steps in code.\n\nFirst, check if the file exists. But the problem says \"simple script\", so maybe assume the file is there.\n\nSo the script steps:\n\n- Read CSV.\n- Clean: drop duplicates, drop NA.\n- Compute summary stats.\n- Print as table.\n\nWait, but maybe the user's data has specific columns. But without more info, I'll make it generic.\n\nLet me write the code.\n\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Read the data\ndf = pd.read_csv('data.csv')\n\n# Clean the data: drop duplicates and missing values\ndf_clean = df.drop_duplicates().dropna()\n\n# Generate summary\nsummary = pd.DataFrame({\n    'Metric': ['Rows before', 'Rows after', 'Columns'],\n    'Value': [len(df), len(df_clean), df_clean.shape[1]]\n})\n\n# Print the summary table\nprint(summary)\n\nBut wait, does this cover \"data cleanup\"? Dropping duplicates and missing values is a common cleanup.\n\nThe user said \"summarizes results in a table\". So this summary table shows the counts.\n\nIs this too simple? Maybe, but the problem says \"simple script\".\n\nWait, the user might have meant that the script should generate a table of the cleaned data, but the problem says \"summarizes results\", so probably the summary table as above"
