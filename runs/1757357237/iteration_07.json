  "output_preview": "<think>\nWe are writing a simple script that automates data cleanup and summarizes results in a table.\n Constraints: Respond in bullet points.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We assume the input is a CSV file (common for data cleanup).\n 2. We'll clean the data: handle missing values, convert to appropriate types, etc.\n 3. Then we'll summarize the data in a table (using pandas for simplicity, but note: we want concise and directly usable output)\n\n However, the user asks for a script that we return in bullet points. We are to write the script in bullet points? \n But note: the instruction says \"Respond in bullet points\". So we are to list the steps of the script? Or the code?\n\n Clarification: The problem says \"Write a simple script ...\". So we are to write the script in code? But the response must be in bullet points.\n\n Let me re-read: \"Respond in bullet points\". So we are to list the bullet points of what the script does? Or the code as bullet points?\n\n The problem says: \"Return precise, directly usable output.\" and \"Respond in bullet points\".\n\n I think the intended output is a bullet list of the key steps or the code? But the problem says \"a simple script\", so we are to write the code.\n\n However, the constraint says: \"Respond in bullet points\". So we have to write the code in a bullet point format? \n\n But note: the user says \"Write a simple script\", so we are to output the code. But the response must be in bullet points.\n\n How about we write the script as a code block but in a bullet point? \n\n Alternatively, the problem might mean: list the steps of the script in bullet points? \n\n Let me think: the problem says \"Return precise, directly usable output\". So we want the user to run the script? \n\n But the problem says: \"Write a simple script\". So I think we are to output the script code.\n\n However, the response must be in bullet points. So we can write:\n\n - [code]\n\n But note: the problem says \"bullet points\", so we have to list the code as a bullet point? \n\n Alternatively, the problem might be asking for a description of the script in bullet points? \n\n Given the constraints, I think the intended response is a bullet point list of the code steps? But the problem says \"a simple script\", meaning we have to write the code.\n\n Let me try to interpret:\n\n Option 1: The user wants the script code, but we output it as a single bullet point? But the problem says \"bullet points\" (plural).\n\n Option 2: We list the steps of the script in bullet points? \n\n Since the problem says \"automates data cleanup and summarizes results in a table\", I think they want the code.\n\n But the instruction: \"Respond in bullet points\" and \"Return precise, directly usable output\".\n\n I'll go with: output the code as a single bullet point? But the problem says \"bullet points\" (plural) so maybe multiple.\n\n Alternatively, we can write:\n\n - The following Python script cleans and summarizes data:\n\n But that's not direct.\n\n After re-thinking: the problem says \"Write a simple script\". So I think they want the code. And the constraint is to respond in bullet points.\n\n How about we write the code in a code block but prefixed by a bullet? \n\n However, the problem says \"bullet points\", so we can do:\n\n * [code]\n\n But the problem says \"precise, directly usable output\". So we want the user to copy the code? \n\n Let me write the script in a way that it's a single bullet point? \n\n But note: the problem says \"bullet points\" (plural). So maybe multiple bullet points for steps? \n\n I think the intended meaning is: the response should be a list of bullet points, each bullet point being a step or a line of code? \n\n However, the problem says \"a simple script\", so it's a code.\n\n I decide: We write the entire script as a single bullet point (with the code inside). But to be safe and concise, we write:\n\n - Python script for data cleanup and summary:\n\n [code]\n\n But the problem says \"bullet points\" (plural) so maybe we break it into steps? \n\n Alternatively, the problem might be asking for the steps of the script in bullet points? \n\n Given the ambiguity, I'll provide the code in a bullet point and hope that the user can run it.\n\n However, the problem says: \"automates data cleanup and summarizes results in a. table\". So we need to write a script that:\n\n 1. Reads a CSV file.\n 2. Cleans the data (e.g., drop nulls, convert to numeric, etc.)\n 3. Summarizes (e.g., mean, median, min, max for numeric columns, counts for categorical)\n 4. Outputs a summary table (to console or a new CSV)\n\n But the problem doesn't specify the"
