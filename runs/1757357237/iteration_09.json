  "output_preview": "<think>\nWe are designing a simple script that automates data cleanup and summarizes results in a table.\n Constraints: Respond in bullet points.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We need to define the data source (e.g., CSV file).\n 2. Data cleanup: This could include handling missing values, duplicates, outliers, etc.\n 3. Summarizing results: We want to create a summary table (e.g., using pandas and then print or save to a file).\n\n However, note: The user says \"simple script\". So we'll keep it minimal.\n\n Let's assume:\n   - Input: A CSV file with some data.\n   - Cleanup: Remove duplicate rows, fill missing values with a placeholder (e.g., 'N/A'), and handle outliers by capping (if needed) or simply drop.\n   - Summary: We'll create a summary table that includes the count, mean, std, min, max for numeric columns and count for categorical.\n\n But note: The problem doesn't specify the data. We have to design a generic approach.\n\n We'll write a Python script (since it's common for data tasks) that:\n   a. Reads a CSV file.\n   b. Cleans the data (with simple steps).\n   c. Generates a summary table (as a pandas DataFrame) and prints it.\n\n However, the problem says \"respond in bullet points\". So we are not writing the code but describing the design in bullet points.\n\n But wait: the user says \"Write a simple script\", but then says \"Respond in bullet points\". So we have to write the bullet points that describe the script.\n\n Clarification: The user wants the script in bullet points? Or the design in bullet points?\n\n Since the instruction says: \"Respond in bullet points\", we'll describe the design of the script in bullet points.\n\n Design of the script:\n\n - We will use Python with pandas for data manipulation and the built-in `print` or `to_csv` for output.\n - Steps:\n      1. Define the input CSV file path.\n      2. Read the CSV into a pandas DataFrame.\n      3. Perform basic data cleanup:\n          a. Drop duplicate rows (if any).\n          b. Fill missing values in numeric columns with the median (to avoid skew) or a placeholder (e.g., 'N/A') for non-numeric.\n          c. (Optional) Handle outliers by capping at 1.5*IQR for numeric columns, but we'll keep it simple: we'll do a basic step without outliers for simplicity.\n      4. Generate a summary table for the cleaned data: we can do a describe() for numeric and count for categorical? But the problem says \"summarizes results in a table\". We'll do a simple summary that includes:\n          - For each column: count, mean, std, min, max (if numeric) and for non-numeric: count (and maybe unique count?).\n      . However, to keep it simple, we'll generate a summary table of the entire data (with the cleaned data) that has the following columns: \n          - Column name, Data type, Count, Mean (if numeric), etc.\n\n But note: the problem doesn't specify the table. So we'll create a summary table that is a simple representation of the data.\n\n Alternative: The problem says \"summarizes results\". We can create a table that shows the cleaned data's statistics.\n\n Let's design:\n\n   We'll create a summary table that has:\n      - Column name\n      - Data type (after cleanup)\n      - Number of non-null values\n      - Mean (if numeric)\n      - Standard deviation (if numeric)\n      - Min\n      - Max\n\n However, we don't want to output the entire data but a summary table.\n\n Steps in bullet points:\n\n  1. **Input Specification**: The script requires a configuration file (or command-line argument) specifying the input CSV path and the output summary table path (optional).\n  2. **Data Loading**: Use pandas to read the CSV file into a DataFrame.\n  3. **Data Cleanup**:\n        a. Drop duplicate rows to avoid redundant data.\n        b. Handle missing values:\n            - For numeric columns: fill with the median of the column (to avoid biasing the mean).\n            - For non-numeric columns: fill with a string placeholder (e.g., 'N/A') or drop if the column has too many missing values (but for simplicity, we'll fill with 'N/A' for non-numeric).\n        c. (Optional) Remove outliers for numeric columns by capping at 1.5 * IQR (but we'll skip for simplicity to keep it simple).\n  4. **Summary Table Generation**:\n        a. Compute descriptive statistics for the cleaned DataFrame.\n        b. Create a new DataFrame that includes:\n            - Column name\n            - Data type (after cleanup)\n            - Count (number of non-null values)\n            - Mean (if numeric)\n            -"
