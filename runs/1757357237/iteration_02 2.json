  "output_preview": "<think>\nWe are writing a simple script that automates data cleanup and summarizes results in a table.\n Constraints: Respond in bullet points.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We'll assume the input is a CSV file (common for data cleanup) but the problem doesn't specify the data type. \n    However, to be simple, let's use CSV as the input format.\n\n 2. The script should:\n    a. Read a CSV file.\n    b. Clean the data: handle missing values, convert to appropriate types, remove duplicates, etc.\n    c. Summarize the results in a table (e.g., a markdown table or a simple text table).\n\n 3. Since we are to be concise and directly usable, we'll write a Python script using standard libraries (no external packages) for simplicity.\n\n 4. We'll do:\n    - Read the CSV with `csv` module.\n    - Clean: \n        * Drop rows with missing values (or fill with a placeholder? but the problem says \"cleanup\", so we'll drop for simplicity)\n        * Convert numeric columns to float (if they are numbers)\n        * Remove duplicate rows\n    - Then, we'll create a summary table (e.g., count of rows, columns, missing values per column, etc.)\n\n 5. However, note: the problem says \"summarizes results in a table\". We can do a simple summary table of the cleaned data's statistics.\n\n 6. Alternatively, we can summarize the data by creating a table of the cleaned data's first few rows and then some statistics.\n\n 7. But the problem says \"summarizes results\", so we'll create a table that shows:\n      - The number of rows and columns before and after cleaning.\n      - The number of missing values per column (if any) after cleaning.\n\n 8. Let's design the script to output a markdown table for the summary.\n\n 9. Steps in the script:\n      a. Import csv\n      b. Read the CSV file (specify the filename as a command line argument or hardcode for simplicity? Since it's simple, we'll hardcode the filename to 'data.csv' for now, but note: in real use, we'd take from command line)\n      c. Clean the data:\n          - Read the file\n          - Skip the header? (if present) - we assume the first row is header.\n          - For each row, if the row has missing values, skip (or fill with 0? but the problem says cleanup, so we'll drop rows with any missing value)\n          - Convert the numeric columns to float (if the column name is numeric? we'll try to detect numeric columns by checking the first row of data? but simple: we'll assume the user knows the structure)\n\n      d. However, to keep it simple and avoid too much complexity, we'll do:\n          - Drop rows with any missing values (using `csv` module: we can check for empty string and skip)\n          - Remove duplicates\n\n      e. Then, we output a summary table.\n\n 10. But note: the problem says \"simple script\". We don't want to overcomplicate.\n\n : Let's write a minimal script that does:\n\n      Input: data.csv (with headers)\n\n      Steps:\n        1. Read the CSV file.\n        2. Clean by:\n            - Removing rows with any missing value (we'll treat empty strings as missing)\n            - Removing duplicate rows (based on all columns)\n        3. Print a summary table in markdown.\n\n 11. Summary table content:\n\n        | Metric                     | Value |\n        |-----------------------------|-------|\n        | Original rows               | 100   |\n        | Original columns            | 5     |\n        | Rows after cleanup          | 95    |\n        | Columns after cleanup       | 5     |\n        | Missing values (original)   | 10    |\n        | Missing values (after)      | 0     |\n\n     But note: the problem doesn't specify what the summary should be. We'll do a simple one.\n\n 12. Alternatively, the problem might mean: summarize the cleaned data in a table? But the problem says \"summarizes results\", meaning the results of the cleanup.\n\n 13. We'll output a table that shows:\n        - The cleaned data has X rows and Y columns.\n        - We can also show the count of unique values per column? But that might be too much for a simple script.\n\n 14. Given the constraints, we'll do a very simple summary.\n\n 15. We choose: \n        - Original rows, original columns\n        - Cleaned rows, cleaned columns\n        - Total missing values in the original data (if any) and after cleaning.\n\n 16. However, note: the problem says \"summarizes results in a table\". We'll output a markdown table for the summary.\n\n 17."
