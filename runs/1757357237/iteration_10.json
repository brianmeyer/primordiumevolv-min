  "output_preview": "<think>\nWe are given a context about automating data cleaning with Python and a constraint to respond in bullet points.\n The task: Write a simple script that automates data cleanup and summarizes results in a table.\n\n We are to be concise and return precise, directly usable output.\n\n Steps to consider (from the context):\n 1. The script should automate data cleaning (removing unwanted data, handling missing values, etc.)\n 2. It should summarize results in a table.\n\n Since the context mentions \"5 Simple Steps\", we can design a minimal script that does:\n   - Load data (e.g., from CSV)\n   - Clean data (e.g., handle missing values, remove duplicates, convert types)\n   - Summarize the cleaning results (e.g., count of missing values per column, duplicates, etc.) in a table.\n\n We'll write a script that is simple and directly usable.\n\n Proposed script structure:\n\n   Step 1: Import necessary libraries (pandas, numpy)\n   Step : Read a CSV file (we assume the file is named 'data.csv')\n   Step: Clean the data (we'll do a minimal set of operations: handle missing values by dropping rows with missing values in critical columns? or fill? but to be safe, we do a simple one: drop rows with missing values in the entire dataframe? Actually, we can do: fill missing with mean for numeric, but for simplicity, we'll drop rows with missing values in the entire dataframe? However, the problem says \"simple\", so let's do: drop rows with any missing value? But that might be too aggressive. Alternatively, we can do a basic summary without altering the data too much.)\n\n   However, the problem says \"summarizes results in a table\". So we are to output a table of the cleaning results.\n\n   Let's define:\n     - We'll create a summary table that includes:\n          * Columns with missing values (count)\n          * Number of duplicates\n          * Data types of columns (for the original data)\n\n   But note: the context says \"automates data cleanup\", so we are cleaning the data and then summarizing the results of the cleanup.\n\n   We can do:\n\n      df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')\n\n      # Step 1: Handle missing values (for example, drop rows with missing values in the entire dataframe? or fill? We'll do a simple: drop rows with missing values)\n      # But to be safe, we'll create a summary without altering the data too much? Actually, we want to show the results of the cleaning steps.\n\n      # Instead, we can do:\n      #   - Count missing values per column (for the original data)\n      #   - Then clean the data by filling missing values (e.g., with median) for numeric columns? But the problem says \"simple\".\n\n      # Given the constraints of simplicity and direct usability, I propose:\n\n      # We'll create a summary table that shows:\n      #   - The original data: missing values per column, duplicate count, and the data types.\n\n      # However, the problem says: \"automates data cleanup\", so we should clean the data and then summarize the results of the cleanup.\n\n      # Let me re-read: \"summarizes results\" meaning the results of the cleanup process.\n\n      # So we do:\n      #   Step 1: Clean the data (we'll do: drop rows with missing values, and drop duplicates)\n      #   Step 2: Then create a table that shows:\n      #        - How many rows were dropped due to missing values\n      #        - How many duplicates were removed\n      #        - The number of rows and columns after cleaning\n\n      # But the context says: \"5 Simple Steps\", so we don't need to be too complex.\n\n      # We'll write a script that:\n      #   - Reads a CSV\n      #   - Drops rows with missing values (we'll do: dropna) -> but note: this is one way to clean\n      #   - Drops duplicates\n      #   - Then outputs a summary table (as a string or to a file? The problem says \"summarizes results in a table\". We can print a table to console)\n\n      # Alternatively, we can output the summary table as a markdown table? But the problem doesn't specify.\n\n      # Since the problem says \"directly usable\", we can output a markdown table to the console.\n\n      # Steps in the script:\n\n      #   import pandas as pd\n\n      #   df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')\n\n      #   # Clean the data: drop missing values and duplicates\n      #   df_clean = df.dropna().drop_duplicates()\n\n      #   # Now, create a summary table that includes:\n      #   #   Original rows, Original columns\n      #   #   Cleaned rows, Cleaned columns\n      #   #   Rows dropped due to missing values\n      #   #   Duplicates removed\n\n"
