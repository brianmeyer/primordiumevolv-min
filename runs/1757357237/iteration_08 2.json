  "output_preview": "<think>\nWe are given a context that says: \"Write a simple script that automates data cleanup and summarizes results in a table.\"\n\nThe examples and constraints:\n- Example: Analyze this data pattern. Pattern shows 20% increase in usage during peak hours, suggesting need for scaling.\n- Constraints: Respond in bullet points.\n\nBut note: The user asks for a script, not a bullet point response? However, the constraints say: \"Respond in bullet points.\"\n\nSo, we must return in bullet points. But the task is to write a simple script. How to reconcile?\n\nRe-read: The user says: \"Write a simple script ...\". But the constraints say: \"Respond in bullet points.\"\n\nSo, we are to return a bullet point list that describes the script? Or the bullet points are for the response to the user? The instruction says: \"Respond in bullet points.\"\n\nGiven the constraints, I think the expected output is a bullet point list that explains the script in a concise way.\n\nBut note: the user says \"Write a simple script\", so they might expect the script code? However, the constraints say \"Respond in bullet points\".\n\nLet me interpret the problem:\n\nWe are to write a script that does:\n1. Data cleanup\n2. Summarizes results in a table\n\nBut we must return in bullet points.\n\nSo, I think the expected response is a bullet point list of steps or a description of the script in bullet points? The problem says: \"Respond in bullet points\".\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be that the user wants the script written in a way that the response is a bullet point list of the script's content? But that seems odd.\n\nAnother interpretation: The user wants a response that is a bullet point list of the key points about the script? But the problem says: \"Write a simple script\".\n\nGiven the constraints, I will write a bullet point list that describes the script in a concise way.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Return precise, directly usable output\". So we must be very concise.\n\nIdea: Since the user asked for a script, but we can only return bullet points, I will write:\n\n- [Script code] in a code block? But the constraint says \"bullet points\", so we can have bullet points that are code? Or we write the bullet points as a description of the script.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"Respond in bullet points\". So I will write:\n\n- A simple Python script that cleans the data (removes nulls, duplicates, etc.) and outputs a summary table in markdown.\n\nBut the user might want the actual script? But the constraint says bullet points.\n\nLet me see the example: \"Example: Analyze this data pattern. Pattern shows ...\". That's just context.\n\nI think the intended response is a bullet point list of the steps the script would take.\n\nBut the problem says: \"automates data cleanup and summarizes results in a table\".\n\nSo, I'll write:\n\n- Script: Python\n- Steps:\n   - Read CSV\n   - Clean: drop nulls, remove duplicates\n   - Compute: usage increase (e.g., peak vs off-peak)\n   - Output table of summary (e.g., peak increase: 20%)\n\nHowever, the user said \"simple\", so we don't want too much.\n\nBut the constraint says: \"Respond in bullet points\". So I'll do:\n\n- Write a Python script that:\n  - Cleans data by dropping missing values and duplicates.\n  - Calculates the percentage increase in usage during peak hours (e.g., by comparing average usage in peak vs off-peak).\n  - Outputs a markdown table with the result (e.g., \"Peak Usage Increase: 20%\").\n\nBut wait, the example says: \"Pattern shows 20% increase in usage during peak hours\". So we are to do that.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"summarizes results in a table\". So the output is a table.\n\nBut the user might be expecting the actual script? But the constraints say bullet points.\n\nGiven the instructions: \"Return precise, directly usable output\", and \"Respond in bullet points\", I will write:\n\n- Simple Python script for data cleanup and summary:\n  ```python\n  import pandas as pd\n\n  # Read data\n  df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')\n\n  # Clean: drop nulls and duplicates\n  df = df.dropna()\n  df = df.drop_duplicates()\n\n  # Calculate peak usage increase (example: peak hours are 10:00-12:00)\n  # Assuming we have a 'timestamp' and 'usage' column\n  df['peak'] = df['timestamp'].apply(lambda x: 1 if x.hour >= 10 and x.hour < 12 else 0)\n  df['usage_peak'] = df['usage'] * df['peak']\n  peak_avg = df['usage_peak'].mean()\n  off_peak_avg = df['usage'].mean() - peak"
