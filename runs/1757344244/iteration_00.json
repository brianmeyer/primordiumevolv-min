So we have to output in bullet points.\n\n Let's think: what is the simplest way?\n\n We can write:\n\n - Define a function `hello_world` that prints \"Hello, World!\".\n\n However, the user says \"simple\", so we don't need to overcomplicate.\n\n But note: the problem says \"Write a simple hello world function\". So we are to write the function.\n\n Since we are to return in bullet points, we can do:\n\n * Here's a simple hello world function:\n\n   def hello_world():\n       print(\"Hello, World!\")\n\n However, the user says \"concise\" and \"precise\". Also, they are a senior engineer so we don't need to explain.\n\n But the response must be in bullet points. So we can write one bullet point.\n\n Alternatively, we can write:\n\n - Function: `hello_world()` prints \"Hello, World!\".\n\n But that's not the code.\n\n The user says: \"Write a simple hello world function\". So they want the code.\n\n Let me re-read: \"Return precise, directly usable output.\"\n\n So I think they want the code in a bullet point.\n\n How about:\n\n * `def hello_world(): print(\"Hello, World!\")`\n\n But note: in some contexts, we might want to be more precise about the language? The problem doesn't specify.\n\n Since it's a common practice, I'll assume Python.\n\n However, the problem says \"simple\", so we can do in any language? But the context of the problem is not specified.\n\n But the user is a senior engineer and they want concise. They might expect a language that is common in the industry.\n\n Let's choose Python because it's simple and widely used.\n\n Alternatively, if they want a function that returns a string, that's also a common hello world.\n\n But the problem says \"hello world function\", and traditionally it's a print.\n\n However, the problem says: \"simple hello world function\". So I think the classic is to print.\n\n But note: the problem says \"function\", so we can do:\n\n Option 1: Print function (most common for hello world)\n Option 2: Return a"
