The problem says concise.\n\n Alternatively, we can write in a more compact way? The problem says \"simple\".\n\n Another idea: the minimal function.\n\n However, the problem says \"hello world function\", so we must have the string.\n\n Let's do:\n\n - `hello_world = lambda: print(\"Hello, World!\")`   (if we want a one-liner)\n\n But the problem says \"simple\", so maybe the lambda is too advanced? \n\n Alternatively, we can write a function that returns the string without printing? But the classic hello world is printed.\n\n The problem says \"hello world\", which traditionally prints.\n\n I think the most standard and simple is:\n\n   def hello_world():\n       print(\"Hello, World!\")\n\n But to be concise, we can write without the function body? No.\n\n Since the constraints say \"bullet points\", I will write:\n\n - A"
