  "output_preview": "<think>\nHmm, the user is asking about popular peptides currently, specifically mentioning BPC-157. They want concise bullet points as a senior engineer would respond. \n\nLooking at the web context provided: There's mention of BPC-157 being compared to other peptides for benefits, RFK Jr. claiming regenerative properties (though that seems like a red flag), and it being noted for good oral bioavailability but not for others like IGF-1. \n\nKey points to extract: \n- BPC-157 is highlighted for oral bioavailability (important for practical use) \n- The context mentions it's in \"top 5 benefits\" discussions but doesn't specify the actual benefits \n- There's an unusual reference to RFK Jr. which might indicate controversial claims - better to note this as a caution \n- The \"4 go-to options\" context suggests BPC-157 is one of several popular peptides but the others aren't named \n\nUser's deeper need: They probably want quick, actionable info without fluff. Since they specified \"concise senior engineer\" output, I should avoid marketing language and focus on verifiable facts from the context. \n\nImportant to flag the RFK Jr. reference as potentially misleading since it's not a standard peptide source - that's a red flag for credibility. Also must clarify that \"good oral bioavailability\" is a relative term (BPC-157 is better than some but not all peptides). \n\nNo need to list unmentioned peptides since the context doesn't specify alternatives beyond BPC-157. Will stick strictly to what the web snippets imply. \n\nFinal check: Bullet points must be direct, no examples, no extra explanations. User said \"precise, directly usable output\" so I'll keep it to 3-4 lines max.\n</think>\n\n- BPC-157: Popular for oral bioavailability (better than many peptides), marketed for tissue repair and regenerative effects; note RFK Jr. claims are controversial and not scientifically validated.  \n- IGF-1: Common alternative for muscle growth, but poor oral bioavailability limits practical use.  \n- Growth hormone (GH) analogs: Used for muscle synthesis, but require injections due to low oral bioavailability.  \n- Collagen peptides: Gaining traction for joint health and skin elasticity, distinct from regenerative peptides like BPC-157."
