  "output_preview": "<think>\nOkay, the user is asking about popular peptides like BPC-157. They want concise, precise information in bullet points. Let me think.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what BPC-157 is. It's a peptide known for promoting tissue healing, especially in the gut and muscles. But I should check if there are other popular ones. Maybe TB-500, which is used in sports for muscle recovery. Then there's CJC-1010, which is a growth hormone-releasing peptide. Also, GHRP-6 is another one that stimulates growth hormone release.\n\nWait, I should verify the current trends. As of 2023, BPC-157 is definitely popular in sports and regenerative medicine. TB-500 is also common in bodybuilding circles. CJC-1010 is more for growth hormone therapy. GHRP-6 is used to boost growth hormone levels.\n\nI need to list each with a brief description, focusing on their primary uses. The user wants bullet points, so I'll structure it that way. Also, the user specified \"different peptides that are popular now like BPC-157\", so I should highlight a few key ones with their applications.\n\nLet me make sure I don't include any incorrect info. For example, BPC-157 is a 157-amino acid peptide, but wait, no\u2014peptides are named by their amino acid count. Wait, BPC-157 is actually a 15-mer (15 amino acids), but the name comes from the original peptide. Maybe that's a detail to skip since the user wants concise info.\n\nFocus on the main points: name, primary use, and current popularity context. Avoid too much technical jargon.\n\nSo bullet points:\n\n- BPC-157: Promotes tissue repair, used in sports medicine for muscle and gut healing.\n- TB-500: Enhances muscle recovery, commonly used in athletic recovery protocols.\n- CJC-1010: Stimulates growth hormone release, popular in anti-aging and bodybuilding.\n- GHRP-6: Growth hormone secretagogue, used to boost natural GH levels.\n\nWait, is CJC-1010 a peptide? Yes, it's a hexapeptide. And GHRP-6 is a hexapeptide too. Make sure the names are correct.\n\nAlso, the user wants \"precise, directly usable output\". So no fluff. Just bullet points with key facts.\n\nCheck if there's another popular one. Maybe TR-101? Not sure. Stick to the most common ones mentioned in current trends.\n\nWait, the example given was a function to reverse a string, so the response should be in bullet points without any extra text. The user said \"Respond in bullet points.\"\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\n- BPC-157: Promotes tissue healing and reduces inflammation; popular in sports recovery and gut repair.\n- TB-500: Enhances muscle regeneration and joint healing; widely used by athletes.\n- CJC-1010: Stimulates growth hormone release; sought after for metabolic and anti-aging applications.\n- GHRP-6: Growth hormone secretagogue; used to increase natural GH levels for athletic performance.\n\nThat's four bullet points. Make sure each is concise. Avoid markdown, just plain text bullets.\n\nAlso, check if the user is referring to peptides in the context of supplements or medical treatments. BPC-157 is often sold as a supplement in the sports world, so the descriptions should reflect that.\n\nYes, this should work. Let me format it as per the constraints.\n</think>\n\n- BPC-157: Promotes tissue repair, reduces inflammation; popular in sports recovery and gut healing.  \n- TB-500: Enhances muscle regeneration and joint repair; widely adopted by athletes for post-injury recovery.  \n- CJC-1010: Stimulates natural growth hormone release; common in anti-aging and metabolic optimization protocols.  \n- GHRP-6: Growth hormone secretagogue; used to elevate natural GH levels for athletic performance and metabolic benefits."
