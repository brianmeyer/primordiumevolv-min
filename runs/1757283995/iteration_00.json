  "output_preview": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to compute the mean and median for the list [1,2,3,4,5]. Hmm, I need to be careful here.\n\nFirst, the mean. The mean is the average, right? So I add up all the numbers and divide by how many there are. Let me check: 1+2 is 3, plus 3 is 6, plus 4 is 10, plus 5 is 15. Total sum is 15. There are 5 numbers, so 15 divided by 5 is 3. So the mean should be 3.\n\nNow the median. The median is the middle number when the list is sorted. Wait, the list is already sorted here: [1,2,3,4,5]. Since there are 5 elements, the median is the third one. Let me count: first is 1, second 2, third 3. So median is 3.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. For an odd number of elements, it's the middle one. For even, it's the average of the two middle ones. Here it's 5 elements, so third is 3. Yep. So both mean and median are 3 here.\n\nThe user wants bullet points. So I should write:\n\n- Mean: 3\n- Median: 3\n\nWait, but the problem says \"provide both values\". So that's it. Let me double-check. Sum is 15, 15/5=3. Median is third element in sorted list (which is already sorted), so 3. Correct.\n\nI think that's it. No mistakes here.\n</think>\n\n- Mean: 3  \n- Median: 3"
