  "output_preview": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to compute the mean and median for the list [1,2,3,4,5]. Hmm, first, the mean. The mean is the average, so I add up all the numbers and divide by how many there are. Let me add them: 1+2 is 3, plus 3 is 6, plus 4 is 10, plus 5 is 15. So total sum is 15. There are 5 numbers, so 15 divided by 5 is 3. So the mean is 3.\n\nNow the median. The median is the middle number when the list is ordered. Since the list is already sorted, and there are 5 elements, the median is the third one. Let's count: first is 1, second 2, third 3. So median is 3.\n\nWait, both are 3? Let me double-check. For the median, with an odd number of elements, it's the middle one. Yes, 5 elements, so index 2 (0-based) is 3. Correct. Mean is definitely 3. So the answer should be mean 3 and median 3.\n</think>\n\n- Mean: 3  \n- Median: 3"
