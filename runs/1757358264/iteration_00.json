  "output_preview": "<think>\nWe are to show how to set up a safe retry loop for an API call with exponential backoff.\n Constraints: Respond in bullet points.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Import necessary modules (e.g., time for sleep, maybe requests for API calls).\n 2. Define the maximum number of retries and the initial delay (exponential backoff base).\n 3. Implement a loop that attempts the API call up to the max retries.\n 4. In case of failure (e.g., HTTP error, timeout), wait for an exponential backoff time before retrying.\n 5. Ensure the loop breaks on success or after max retries.\n . We'll use a safe retry pattern that avoids infinite loops and handles exceptions.\n\n Important: We want to be safe so we don't retry on non-retryable errors (like 500 errors might be retried, but 400 errors should not).\n\n However, note: The problem says \"safe retry loop\". We assume the user will handle the exception types appropriately.\n\n Let's write in bullet points:\n\n - Import the `time` module for sleep and `requests` for the API call (if using requests; adjust as needed for your API client).\n - Define the maximum number of retries (e.g., 5) and the initial backoff time (e.g., 1 second).\n - Use a loop that runs up to the maximum retries:\n     * On each iteration, attempt the API call.\n     * If the call succeeds, break the loop and return the result.\n     * If the call fails (with an exception or HTTP error), calculate the next backoff time (exponentially increasing) and wait.\n - For exponential backoff: \n        backoff_time = initial_delay * (2 ** (retry_count - 1))\n     But note: we don't want to go beyond a maximum backoff time (e.g., 30 seconds) to avoid excessive delays.\n - Handle specific exceptions (e.g., HTTP errors) to avoid retrying on non-retryable errors (like 400, 401, 404, 500 might be retried but 400 is not). \n   However, the problem doesn't specify the exception types, so we'll assume the user will define which exceptions to retry.\n - After max retries, raise the last exception to propagate the failure.\n\n But note: The problem says \"safe\". So we must avoid retrying on non-retryable errors.\n\n Let's structure the bullet points without code examples (since we want concise) but with enough detail.\n\n However, the user asked for precise, directly usable output. So we'll write in bullet points that are actionable.\n\n Proposed bullet points:\n\n - Import `time` for sleep and your API client (e.g., `requests`).\n - Set max_retries (e.g., 5) and initial_delay (e.g., 1.0 seconds).\n - For retry_count in range(max_retries):\n     * Try to make the API call.\n     * If successful, return the result.\n     * If exception occurs (e.g., HTTPError, timeout), calculate backoff = initial_delay * (2 ** retry_count)\n        - Cap backoff at max_backoff (e.g., 30 seconds) to prevent excessive delays.\n     * Wait for backoff time.\n - If all retries fail, re-raise the last exception.\n\n But note: We must be cautious about the exception types. We don't want to retry on non-retryable errors.\n\n Alternative: The user might want to define a list of exceptions to retry (e.g., [ConnectionError, Timeout, HTTPError] for some cases). \n\n However, the problem says: \"safe retry loop\". So we'll assume the user will handle the exceptions appropriately.\n\n Let's write:\n\n - Define a list of exceptions to retry (e.g., `retry_exceptions = [ConnectionError, Timeout, HTTPError]`).\n - In the loop, catch the exception and check if it is in `retry_exceptions`.\n - If it is, then wait and retry; otherwise, re-raise the exception.\n\n But note: the problem doesn't specify the exception types, so we'll keep it generic.\n\n Given the constraints, here's the concise bullet point response:\n\n* Import `time` and your API client (e.g., `requests`).\n* Define `max_retries = 5` and `initial_delay = 1.0`.\n* Define `max_backoff = 30.0` (optional, to cap backoff).\n* Define `retry_exceptions = [Exception]` (or specific exceptions as needed).\n* For `retry_count` in `range(max_retries)`:\n   - Try: make API call\n   - Except `exception` in `retry_exceptions`:\n        - Calculate `backoff = min(initial_delay * (2 ** retry_count), max_backoff)`\n        - `time.sleep(backoff)`\n        - Continue to next retry"
