  "output_preview": "<think>\nWe are to set up a safe retry loop for an API call with exponential backoff.\n Constraints: Respond in bullet points.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We'll use a library that supports exponential backoff (like `tenacity` in Python) but the question doesn. \n    However, the user didn't specify a language. Since the context is general, I'll describe in a way that's language-agnostic but with a common example (Python) as it's widely used.\n\n 2. But note: the problem says \"precise, directly usable output\". So we have to be concise and in bullet points.\n\n 3. We can do:\n    - Define a maximum number of retries.\n    - Start with a small delay (e.g., 1 second) and double the delay after each failure (exponential backoff).\n    - Include a randomization factor to avoid hitting the same time (to reduce server load).\n    - Handle the exception in the retry loop (e.g., if the API call fails, retry with backoff).\n    - Break the loop if the maximum retries are reached.\n\n 4. Since the user didn't specify a language, I'll write in Python as it's common and the code is directly usable.\n\n However, the problem says \"respond in bullet points\". So we'll write bullet points that are code snippets or steps.\n\n Let me think of a concise way:\n\n Bullet points:\n\n - Use a maximum retry count (e.g., 5) to avoid infinite loops.\n - Start with a base delay (e.g., 1 second) and multiply by 2 after each failure (exponential backoff).\n - Add random jitter (e.g., 0.1 * base_delay) to the delay to avoid synchronized retries.\n - Implement a loop that attempts the API call, and on failure (exception), waits for the calculated delay before retrying.\n - Break the loop after max retries or on success.\n\n But the user wants \"directly usable output\". So we can write a minimal code example in a bullet point.\n\n However, the problem says \"bullet points\", so I'll write:\n\n * Define a maximum number of retries (e.g., 5).\n * Initialize a delay multiplier (e.g., 1.0) and a base delay (e.g., 1 second).\n * For each retry attempt:\n      * Try to make the API call.\n      * If successful, break.\n      * If failed, calculate the next delay: `delay = base_delay * multiplier + random.uniform(0, base_delay)`.\n      * Wait for the delay (using sleep).\n      * Double the multiplier (or multiply by 2) for the next retry.\n * Stop after max retries.\n\n But note: the problem says \"safe retry loop\". We must consider:\n   - The API might be rate-limited, so we don't want to retry too fast.\n   - We should catch specific exceptions (e.g., network errors, 5xx) but not retry on 4xx (if the user expects to handle 4xx differently).\n\n However, the problem is about a safe retry loop for an API call. We assume the API call might fail due to transient issues.\n\n Let me write a bullet point that is a code snippet for Python (since it's the most common in this context) but the problem doesn't specify language.\n\n But the constraint says: \"precise, directly usable output\". I think the user expects code in a common language? \n\n Alternatively, we can write in pseudo-code? But the problem says \"directly usable\", so code.\n\n Since the problem is from a senior engineer and we want concise, I'll write:\n\n * Python example (for direct use):\n   ```python\n   import time\n   import random\n\n   max_retries = 5\n   base_delay = 1  # seconds\n   multiplier = 1.0\n\n   for attempt in range(max_retries):\n       try:\n           # Make API call here (replace with your actual call)\n           response = api_call()\n           if response.status_code == 200:\n               break\n       except Exception as e:\n           if attempt == max_retries - 1:\n               raise e  # Last attempt failed, re-raise\n           delay = base_delay * multiplier + random.uniform(0, base_delay)\n           time.sleep(delay)\n           multiplier *= 2\n   ```\n\n But the problem says \"bullet points\", so we can have:\n\n - Set `max_retries` to a safe number (e.g., 5).\n - Set `base_delay` (initial delay in seconds, e.g., 1).\n - Initialize `multiplier` to 1.0.\n - Loop up to `max_retries` times:\n      * Attempt API call.\n      * On success, break.\n      * On failure (any exception), compute next delay: `delay = base_delay * multiplier + random.uniform(0, base_delay)`.\n      * Wait `delay` seconds.\n      * Update"
