  "output_preview": "<think>\nWe are to show how to set up a safe retry loop for an API call with exponential backoff.\n Constraints: Respond in bullet points.\n\n Key points for a safe retry loop with exponential backoff:\n 1. We want to avoid too many retries and too fast retries (to prevent overwhelming the server).\n 2. Exponential backoff: The wait time between retries increases exponentially (e.g., 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, etc.)\n 3. We should have a maximum number of retries to avoid infinite loops.\n 4. We should handle exceptions appropriately (e.g., network errors, server errors) and not retry on all exceptions.\n 5. We might want to use a jitter to avoid all clients retrying at the same time (to distribute load).\n\n Steps in bullet points:\n\n - Define the maximum number of retries (e.g., 5) and the initial delay (e.g., 100ms).\n - Implement exponential backoff with jitter: `delay = (initial_delay * (2 ** retry_count)) + random.uniform(0, initial_delay)`\n - Use a retry mechanism that only retries on specific exceptions (e.g., network errors, 5xx server errors) and not on transient errors that are not retryable.\n - Add a maximum retry count to prevent infinite loops.\n - Include a condition to stop the retry loop if the request succeeds or if a maximum number of retries is reached.\n - Consider using a library for simplicity (e.g., `tenacity` in Python) but since the question doesn't specify language, we'll keep it language-agnostic or note that it's common in many languages.\n\n However, the problem says \"precise, directly usable output\". So we'll write in a way that can be adapted to common languages (like Python) but without being too language-specific.\n\n But note: the constraint says \"Respond in bullet points\". We are to be concise.\n\n Let's write in bullet points that are generally applicable:\n\n - Set a maximum retry count (e.g., 5) and initial backoff delay (e.g., 100ms).\n - For each retry attempt (starting at 1):\n     * Calculate the wait time: `backoff = initial_delay * (2 ** (retry_count - 1)) + random.uniform(0, initial_delay)`\n     * Wait for the calculated time (with jitter).\n     * Attempt the API call.\n - If the call succeeds, break the loop.\n - If the call fails with a retryable error (e.g., 5xx, network issues), increment the retry count and repeat.\n - If the retry count exceeds the maximum, raise the exception after the last attempt.\n - Avoid retrying on non-retryable errors (e.g., 400, 401, 404, or permanent errors).\n\n However, to be more precise and safe, we can structure it as:\n\n But note: the user might be expecting a code snippet? But the constraint says bullet points and we are to be concise.\n\n Alternatively, we can write in a way that is a step-by-step for a developer to implement.\n\n Let's do:\n\n - Define max_retries and initial_delay (e.g., max_retries=5, initial_delay=0.1 seconds).\n - Use a loop that runs up to max_retries times:\n     * For each iteration (from 0 to max_retries-1):\n         - Calculate backoff time: `backoff = initial_delay * (2 ** iteration) + random.uniform(0, initial_delay)`\n         - Sleep for `backoff` seconds.\n         - Attempt the API call.\n         - If successful, return the result.\n         - If failed with a retryable exception (e.g., HTTP 5xx, connection error), retry.\n - If all retries exhausted, raise the last exception.\n\n But to be safe and direct:\n\n We'll write:\n\n * Set max_retries (e.g., 5) and initial_backoff (e.g., 100ms).\n * For retry_count in 0 to max_retries-1:\n     * Compute backoff = (initial_backoff * (2 ** retry_count)) + random.uniform(0, initial_backoff)\n     * Wait for backoff duration.\n     * Attempt API call.\n     * If success: return result.\n     * If failure is retryable (e.g., 5xx status, network error): continue to next retry.\n * If max_retries reached, re-raise the exception.\n\n However, note: we don't want to retry on 4xx? So we must check the error.\n\n But the user said \"safe\", so we have to be careful.\n\n Let's make it bullet points:\n\n - Define maximum number of retries (e.g., 5) and initial backoff duration (e.g., 100ms).\n - Implement a loop that runs for up to `max_retries` times:\n     - Calculate the next back"
