  "output_preview": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, I need to write a Python function called dedupe_list that takes a list xs and returns a new list with duplicates removed, while preserving the original order. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember that in Python, if you want to preserve order and remove duplicates, you can't just use a set because sets are unordered. So the challenge is to maintain the order of first occurrence.\n\nWait, there's a common trick for this. Like using a set to track seen items and then building a new list. Let me think. So for each element in the original list, if it hasn't been seen before, add it to the new list and mark it as seen. That way, the order is preserved.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Initialize an empty set to keep track of elements that have been added to the result list.\n2. Initialize an empty list for the result.\n3. Iterate through each element in xs.\n4. For each element, check if it's in the seen set.\n5. If not, add it to the result list and add it to the seen set.\n6. Return the result list.\n\nWait, but in Python, the 'in' operator for sets is O(1) on average, so this should be efficient.\n\nLet me write this out in code.\n\nWait, the function should be called dedupe_list(xs). So:\n\ndef dedupe_list(xs):\n    seen = set()\n    result = []\n    for x in xs:\n        if x not in seen:\n            seen.add(x)\n            result.append(x)\n    return result\n\nWait, but I need to check if this works. Let's test with an example. Like [1, 2, 2, 3]. The result should be [1,2,3]. The code would add 1, then 2, then skip the second 2, then add 3. So yes, that's correct.\n\nAnother example: [3, 1, 2, 1]. The result would be [3,1,2]. The code would process 3 first, add to result, then 1 (not seen), add to result, then 2 (add), then 1 (already seen, skip). So correct.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nWait, but what about the order? Since we're iterating the original list and adding to the result when first seen, the order is preserved.\n\nYes, this seems right.\n\nSo the code is straightforward. The key is using a set to track seen elements and building the result list.\n\nI think that's the solution. Let me make sure there's no edge cases. Like empty list: if xs is empty, then the result is empty list. The code would loop zero times, so returns empty list. Correct.\n\nSo the function should be as written.\n</think>\n\n- Use a set to track seen elements and a list for result\n- Iterate through input list, append to result if element not in seen set\n- Maintain original order by processing elements sequentially\n- Return result list with duplicates removed"
