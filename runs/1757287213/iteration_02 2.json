  "output_preview": "<think>\nHmm, the user wants me to summarize a specific phrase in under 15 words including the word 'local'. They also want it in bullet points format. \n\nThe phrase is \"Local generation with rigorous evaluation improves reliability.\" I need to be super concise here. Counting words carefully - the original has 6 words. I should aim for 1-3 words max since they want under 15.\n\nKey points to preserve: must include 'local', must convey that generation + evaluation \u2192 better reliability. The phrase emphasizes \"rigorous evaluation\" as the improvement mechanism.\n\nBrainstorming options:\n- \"Local generation + rigorous eval boosts reliability\" \u2192 5 words\n- \"Local eval enhances gen reliability\" \u2192 4 words (but loses \"rigorous\" nuance)\n- \"Rigorous local eval improves gen reliability\" \u2192 5 words (best balance)\n\nUser specified \"precise, directly usable output\" so I'll pick the clearest 5-word version that keeps all critical elements. \n\nWait - they said \"including 'local'\" so I must have that word. Also need to be under 15 words total (which is easy here). \n\nFinal decision: \"Rigorous local eval improves generation reliability\" is exactly 5 words and covers it. But \"generation\" might be redundant? Original says \"local generation\" so... \n\nBetter version: \"Local rigorous eval boosts reliability\" \u2192 4 words. Checks all boxes: includes 'local', under 15 words, captures essence.\n\n*Word count verification*: Local (1) rigorous (2) eval (3) boosts (4) reliability (5). Perfect.\n\nUser wants bullet points - so I'll output as single bullet point since they said \"bullet points\" plural but one point fits. \n\n*Double-checking constraints*: Under 15 words? Yes. Includes 'local'? Yes. Precise? Yes. Directly usable? Yes.\n\nOkay, response ready.\n</think>\n\n- Local rigorous eval boosts reliability"
