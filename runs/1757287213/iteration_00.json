  "output_preview": "<think>\nHmm, the user wants me to summarize a specific phrase in under 15 words while including the word 'local'. They also want it in bullet points format. \n\nLooking at the phrase \"Local generation with rigorous evaluation improves reliability\" - I need to distill this down to its essence. The core idea is that doing things locally (like generating content) and evaluating them strictly leads to more reliable outcomes. \n\nThe word count is critical here - must be under 15 words total. I'll try to be super concise while keeping \"local\" as required. \n\nConsidering options: \n\"Local generation and strict evaluation boost reliability\" is 6 words - perfect. \n\"Local processing with rigorous checks enhances reliability\" is 5 words but loses \"evaluation\" nuance. \n\"Local generation improves reliability via rigorous evaluation\" is 6 words but slightly longer than necessary.\n\nThe first option seems best - it captures the key elements (local, generation, evaluation, reliability) in minimal words while staying under 15. \n\nUser specified bullet points so I'll format as a single bullet point. They're a senior engineer so they'll appreciate precision. No fluff - just the facts they need.\n\n*checks word count* Yep, \"Local generation and strict evaluation boost reliability\" is exactly 6 words. Nailed the constraints.\n</think>\n\n- Local generation and strict evaluation boost reliability"
