  "output_preview": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants a simple Python function that adds two numbers. Let me check the context they provided. Hmm, the context seems to be about a riddle involving Alice and Bob with numbers, but the user specifically asked for a function that adds two numbers. The constraints say to respond in bullet points and be concise.\n\nWait, the context mentions \"positive integers\" and some puzzle, but the user's actual request is straightforward: write a Python function for adding two numbers. The RAG context might be a bit messy with the problem statement, but the user probably just wants the function without getting into the puzzle details.\n\nI should ignore the context parts that are irrelevant. The key is to create a simple function. The function should take two numbers, add them, and return the result. In Python, that's easy. Let me think: def add(a, b): return a + b. But the user said \"simple\", so maybe even a lambda, but a regular function is clearer.\n\nWait, the user said \"precise, directly usable output\". So bullet points with the function code. The constraints say \"Respond in bullet points\". So the answer should be a single bullet point with the code.\n\nWait, the user's instruction says: \"Respond in bullet points.\" So maybe just one bullet point with the code. Let me check the example. The RAG context is a bit jumbled with numbers and names, but the user wants the addition function. So the function is straightforward.\n\nI think the answer is a bullet point with the function definition. Let me write it as:\n\n- def add(a, b): return a + b\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"simple Python function\". This is simple. Alternatively, maybe using input? No, the user says \"adds two numbers\", so the function takes two numbers as parameters. The RAG context mentions positive integers, but the function doesn't need to check that\u2014it's just a simple addition.\n\nYes, the function is straightforward. So the response is a bullet point with that code. I should make sure it's concise. The user wants precise output. So the answer is one bullet point with the function.\n</think>\n\n- def add(a, b): return a + b"
