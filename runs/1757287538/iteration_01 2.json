  "output_preview": "<think>\nHmm, the user is asking for the chemical formula of water. They want a concise response as a senior engineer would give it, and they specified to respond in bullet points. \n\nFirst, I recall that water's chemical formula is H\u2082O - that's basic chemistry. Since they want it precise and directly usable, I shouldn't overcomplicate it. \n\nThe constraints say \"bullet points\" but for a single formula, a single bullet point makes sense. I'll just state it cleanly without extra fluff. \n\nUser seems technical - probably a student or professional who needs quick reference. No need for explanations like \"why\" or \"how\" since they said \"precise, directly usable output\". \n\nI'll format it as: \u2022 H\u2082O \n\nThat's exactly what they need. No markdown, just plain text bullet point as instructed. Keeping it to one line maintains conciseness.\n</think>\n\n\u2022 H\u2082O"
