  "output_preview": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to create a Python function that uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes to find all prime numbers up to N. Let me think about how the Sieve works.\n\nFirst, the Sieve of Eratosthenes starts by creating a list of integers from 2 to N. Then, it marks the multiples of each prime starting from 2. The primes are the numbers that remain unmarked after the process.\n\nWait, the user wants it to be efficient. So I should make sure to optimize it. For example, once you start marking multiples from the square of the prime, because smaller multiples would have already been marked by previous primes.\n\nLet me recall the steps:\n\n1. Initialize a boolean list `is_prime` of length N+1, where `is_prime[i]` is True if i is prime.\n2. Set `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` to False (since 0 and 1 are not primes).\n3. Iterate from 2 to sqrt(N). For each prime number i, mark all multiples of i starting from i*i as non-prime.\n\nWait, the code example from GeeksforGeeks might be helpful here. Let me try to write the code.\n\nWait, the user said \"precise, directly usable output\". So I need to write a concise function.\n\nLet me think: The function should take N as input and return a list of primes up to N.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"all prime numbers up to N\". So the function should return primes <= N.\n\nLet me draft the code.\n\ndef sieve_of_eratosthenes(n):\n    if n < 2:\n        return []\n    is_prime = [True] * (n + 1)\n    is_prime[0] = False\n    is_prime[1] = False\n    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n        if is_prime[i]:\n            for j in range(i * i, n + 1, i):\n                is_prime[j] = False\n    return [i for i in range(2, n + 1) if is_prime[i]]\n\nWait, but is this efficient? The inner loop starts at i*i, which is correct because smaller multiples have already been marked by previous primes.\n\nWait, but the range for i is up to sqrt(n), which is correct. For example, if n is 100, sqrt"
