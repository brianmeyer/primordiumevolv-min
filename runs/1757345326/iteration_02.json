  "output_preview": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to create a Python function that finds all prime numbers up to N using the Sieve of Eratosthenes. The user wants it efficient and concise. Hmm, the Sieve of Eratosthenes is a classic algorithm for this. Let me recall how it works.\n\nFirst, the idea is to create a boolean array where each index represents a number. Initially, all numbers from 2 to N are marked as prime (True). Then, starting from 2, we mark all multiples of each prime as non-prime (False). The process stops when we reach the square root of N because any composite number larger than that would have been marked by a smaller factor.\n\nWait, the constraints say to respond in bullet points, so I need to structure the answer that way. Let me think about the key steps.\n\nThe function should take an integer N as input. If N is less than 2, return an empty list since there are no primes below 2.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Handle edge cases: if N < . So return [].\n\n2. Create a boolean list `is_prime` of length N+1, where index 0 and 1 are False (since 0 and 1 are not primes).\n\n3. Mark 2 as prime (index 2 is True), then iterate from 2 to sqrt(N). For each prime number i, mark all multiples of i starting from i*i as non-prime.\n\nWait, but in the Sieve, you start from i*i because smaller multiples would have already been marked by previous primes.\n\nWait, for example, when i=2, you mark 4,6,8,... So starting at i*i.\n\nBut if N is small, like 10, then sqrt(N) is about 3.16, so i goes up to 3.\n\nSo the loop should be for i in range(2, int(N**0.5) +1).\n\nWait, but in Python, the range function uses exclusive upper bound, so int(N**0.5) +1.\n\nThen, for each i, if is_prime[i] is True, then for j in range(i*i, N+1, i), set is_prime[j] = False.\n\nAfter processing all, collect all indices where is_prime[i] is True, starting from 2 up to N.\n\nWait, but the user wants the primes up to N. So the function should return"
