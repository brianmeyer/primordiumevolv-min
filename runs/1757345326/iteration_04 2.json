  "output_preview": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants a Python function to find all primes up to N using the Sieve of Eratosthenes. They specified to respond in bullet points, so I need to outline the solution steps clearly.\n\nFirst, I should recall how the Sieve of Eratosthenes works. The basic idea is to iteratively mark non-prime numbers starting from 2. The algorithm starts with a list of numbers from 2 to N, then for each prime number, mark all its multiples as composite.\n\nWait, but the user wants efficiency. So the standard sieve might not be the most efficient, but the problem says to use the Sieve of Eruses, so we have to follow that method. Let me think about the steps.\n\nFirst, create a boolean list of size N+1, where index 0 and 1 are not primes. Initialize all as True except 0 and 1.\n\nThen, iterate from 2 to sqrt(N). For each prime number i, mark multiples of i starting from i*i as False. Because smaller multiples would have already been marked by smaller primes.\n\nWait, why start from i*i? Because if i is prime, then multiples of i less than i*i would have already been marked by smaller primes. For example, 2's multiples up to 4 (2*2) would be 4, which is the first multiple that's not covered by smaller primes.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. If N is less than 2, return empty list since there are no primes.\n2. Create a boolean list `is_prime` of length N+1, all True initially. Set is_prime[0] = False, is_prime[1] = False.\n3. Iterate i from 2 to sqrt(N) (inclusive).\n4. For each i that is still prime (is_prime[i] is True), mark multiples of i starting from i*i as False.\n5. After processing, collect all indices where is_prime[i] is True.\n\nWait, but the loop for i should go up to sqrt(N), because once you go beyond that, the multiples would have already been marked.\n\nLet me check the time complexity. The sieve runs in O(N log log N), which is efficient for the sieve.\n\nNow, possible constraints for the function. The user says \"efficiently find all primes up to N\". So the function should handle N up to a reasonable size, but Python's memory might be an issue for"
