  "output_preview": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to translate 'Good morning' into Spanish, specifically two words. Hmm, I need to recall the correct Spanish phrase. First, \"Good morning\" in Spanish is usually \"Buenos d\u00edas\". Wait, but that's two words? Let me check.\n\nWait, \"Buenos\" is one word and \"d\u00edas\" is another. So \"Buenos d\u00edas\" is two words. But sometimes people might write it with a space. Wait, in Spanish, the phrase is \"Buenos d\u00edas\" which is two words. Let me confirm. For example, in some contexts, it's written as \"Buenos d\u00edas\" with a space between the two words. So the translation here is two words: \"Buenos d\u00edas\".\n\nWait, but the user specified two words. Let as check if there's another phrase. Maybe \"Buenos dias\" without the accent? But the standard is with the accent. However, in some regions, they might write it differently. But the correct translation is \"Buenos d\u00edas\".\n\nWait, the user says two words. Let me count: \"Buenos\" (1) and \"d\u00edas\" (2). So two words. So the answer is \"Buenos d\u00edas\".\n\nBut the user wants it in two words. So the translation is \"Buenos d\u00edas\". Let me make sure there's no other two-word phrase. Like \"Buenos dias\" without the accent? But the standard Spanish uses the accented \"d\u00edas\". However, in some informal contexts, people might drop the accent, but the correct answer should be with the accent.\n\nWait, the problem says \"two words\". So the answer is \"Buenos d\u00edas\" as two words. So the translation is \"Buenos d\u00edas\".\n\nI think that's it. Let me check quickly. For example, in Spanish, \"Good morning\" is \"Buenos d\u00edas\" (two words). Yes, so the answer is \"Buenos d\u00edas\".\n</think>\n\n- Buenos d\u00edas"
