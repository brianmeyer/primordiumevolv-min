  "output_preview": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants real-world use cases for self-tuning or evolutionary AI that can be deployed today. They specified concise, technical language. \n\nFirst, I need to clarify what they mean by \"self-tuning\" and \"evolutionary AI.\" Self-tuning usually refers to systems that automatically adjust their parameters without human intervention\u2014like adaptive algorithms. Evolutionary AI is more about algorithms inspired by natural selection, like genetic algorithms that iteratively improve solutions through mutation and selection.\n\nHmm, the user is a senior engineer, so they'll expect concrete, current examples\u2014not theoretical stuff. They want things that are actually used now, not prototypes. Gotta avoid fluff.\n\nLet me brainstorm real deployments. For self-tuning: cloud infrastructure auto-scaling is a classic. AWS Auto Scaling groups tweak instances based on load\u2014no manual tuning needed. That's production-grade. Also, database query optimization\u2014like how PostgreSQL's adaptive query planner adjusts execution plans on the fly. \n\nFor evolutionary AI: genetic algorithms are used in hardware design. For example, Intel uses them to optimize processor layouts. And in finance, hedge funds use evolutionary methods for portfolio optimization\u2014like optimizing asset weights to maximize returns while managing risk. \n\nWait, is portfolio optimization evolutionary? Some use genetic algorithms, but I should confirm it's deployed today. Yeah, firms like Two Sigma use them. Good. \n\nAlso, neural architecture search (NAS) is a hot topic. Companies like Google deploy NAS to auto-generate efficient neural networks for mobile apps\u2014like TensorFlow Lite optimizations. That's self-tuning in a way since it evolves models without manual design. \n\nUser said \"today,\" so no future stuff. Must be live deployments. Let me double-check: \n\n- AWS Auto Scaling: definitely live. \n- PostgreSQL adaptive query planner: live since ~2018. \n- Intel's chip design: yes, used in recent processors. \n- Hedge fund portfolio optimization: real companies use GA for this. \n- NAS in production: Google's MobileNet was discovered via NAS. \n\nAvoid jargon overload. Keep it tight. User wants precise output. \n\nStructure: List 4-5 cases with minimal explanation. Focus on the tech name and deployment context. \n\nNo markdown. Just bullet points in plain text. \n\nFinal check: Are these truly \"self-tuning\" or \"evolutionary\"? \n\nSelf-tuning: Auto-scaling (adaptive), PostgreSQL planner (adaptive). \n\nEvolutionary: Intel chip design (genetic algorithms), hedge funds (GA), NAS (evolutionary search). \n\nYep. Cut the fluff. User's a senior engineer\u2014they'll know the terms. \n\nOutput should be: \n\n- Cloud auto-scaling (AWS) \n- Adaptive query planning (PostgreSQL) \n- Hardware optimization (Intel) \n- Portfolio optimization (hedge funds) \n- Neural architecture search (Google) \n\nThat's five. Maybe trim to four for conciseness? But user said \"list,\" so five is fine. \n\nMake sure each line starts with a verb or tech name for impact. \n\n\"Cloud auto-scaling (AWS): self-tuning resource allocation\" \u2013 too wordy. Just \"AWS auto-scaling: self-tuning resource allocation\" \n\nYes. \n\nFinal list: \n\n1. AWS auto-scaling: self-tuning resource allocation \n2. PostgreSQL adaptive query planner: self-t: adaptive query execution \n3. Intel chip design: evolutionary optimization \n4. Hedge fund portfolio optimization: genetic algorithms \n5. Google NAS: neural architecture search \n\n\"self-tuning\" vs \"evolutionary\" distinction matters. For #1 and #2, it's self-tuning (adaptive). For #3, #4, #5: evolutionary. \n\nUser said \"self-tuning or evolutionary,\" so cover both. \n\nOkay, that's precise. Keep it to 5 items max. \n\nWrite it concisely.\n</think>\n\n- AWS auto-scaling: self-tuning resource allocation  \n- PostgreSQL adaptive query planner: self-tuning query execution  \n- Intel chip design: evolutionary hardware optimization  \n- Hedge fund portfolio optimization: genetic algorithms  \n- Google NAS: neural architecture search for mobile models"
