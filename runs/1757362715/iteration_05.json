  "output_preview": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants real-world use cases for self-tuning or evolutionary AI that can be deployed today. They specified concise, technical language. \n\nFirst, I need to clarify what they mean by \"self-tuning\" and \"evolutionary AI.\" Self-tuning usually refers to systems that automatically adjust their parameters without human intervention\u2014like adaptive algorithms in machine learning. Evolutionary AI is more about evolutionary algorithms (EAs) that mimic natural selection, like genetic algorithms for optimization. But the user said \"self-tuning or evolutionary,\" so I should cover both approaches where the system evolves its own parameters or models.\n\nThe key constraint is \"deployed today\"\u2014so no futuristic stuff. Must be current, real-world applications. I'll avoid anything too theoretical or in early research stages. \n\nHmm, the user is a senior engineer, so they'll want precise, actionable examples. No fluff. They said \"concise,\" so I'll aim for 3-4 bullet points max, each with a clear context and technical mechanism. \n\nLet me brainstorm real cases: \n\n1. **AutoML pipelines**: Tools like Google's AutoML or H2O.ai do self-tuning for model selection. They're deployed in production for things like image classification. That fits\u2014evolutionary aspects? Well, some AutoML uses evolutionary search for hyperparameters, but most are gradient-based. Still, it's self-tuning in practice. \n\n2. **Real-time anomaly detection**: Systems like those in cloud monitoring (e.g., AWS CloudWatch) use adaptive models. If the model self-tunes to new data patterns, that's self-tuning. Evolutionary AI? Maybe not directly, but the concept of continuous optimization aligns. \n\n3.. **Neural architecture search (NAS)**: Companies like TensorFlow use evolutionary methods to design neural networks. It's deployed in production for mobile apps (e.g., optimizing models for edge devices). That's evolutionary AI in action. \n\n4. **Reinforcement learning (RL) agents**: Self-tuning RL agents for robotics\u2014like Boston Dynamics' robots that adapt to new environments. But is that \"today\"? Yes, they have production systems. Evolutionary AI might be a stretch here (RL is more gradient-based), but some RL uses evolutionary strategies. \n\nWait, the user said \"self-tuning or evolutionary,\" so I should prioritize cases where the system *actively* evolves its own parameters without manual tuning. \n\n*Double-checking deployment status*: \n- AutoML: Widely used in industry (e.g., healthcare for diagnostics). \n- NAS: Used by companies like Google for mobile apps. \n- Adaptive anomaly detection: Common in finance (credit scoring) and cloud. \n- RL for robotics: More niche but deployed (e.g., drone navigation). \n\nI'll pick the most concrete ones: \n1. **AutoML hyperparameter optimization** \u2013 uses evolutionary algorithms (e.g., genetic algorithms) to find optimal model configs. Deployed in production by enterprises. \n2. **Adaptive anomaly detection** \u2013 systems that self-tune model thresholds using real-time data (e.g., in network security). \n3. **Neural architecture search** \u2013 for deploying efficient models on edge devices (e.g., mobile apps). \n\nAvoid jargon overload. User wants technical but direct. \n\n*Final check*: Are these \"today\"? Yes. No speculative examples. \n\nOutput format: Bullet points, each starting with a verb for action. Keep it tight.\n</think>\n\n- **AutoML hyperparameter optimization**: Production systems (e.g., Google Vertex AI, H2O) use evolutionary algorithms to auto-tune model configurations without manual intervention.  \n- **Adaptive anomaly detection**: Real-time systems (e.g., AWS GuardDuty, Splunk) self-tune detection thresholds via continuous retraining on streaming data.  \n- **Neural architecture search (NAS)**: Deployed in edge applications (e.g., mobile health apps) to evolve lightweight neural network structures via evolutionary optimization."
