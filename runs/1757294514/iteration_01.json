  "output_preview": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants me to write a simple function to add two numbers. Let me think. The example given is for reversing a string, which uses slicing. So they want a concise function.\n\nFirst, the function should take two parameters, maybe named a and b. Then return their sum. In Python, the simplest way is a + b.\n\nWait, the constraints say to respond in bullet points. But the user said \"return precise, directly usable output\". Wait, the instructions say: \"Respond in bullet points.\" Hmm, but the example shows a code block. Wait, the user's instruction says: \"Write a simple function to add two numbers\" with the context of examples like reverse_string.\n\nWait, the user wants me to output the function as a bullet point? Wait, the problem says: \"Respond in bullet points.\" So maybe they want the answer as a bullet point list. Wait, but the example they gave is a code block. Wait, no, the user says \"Respond in bullet points.\" So the answer should be a bullet point with the code?\n\nWait, the original instruction says: \"Return precise, directly usable output.\" And \"Respond in bullet points.\"\n\nWait, the user is a senior engineer, so they want a concise answer. Let me think. The function to add two numbers in Python is straightforward.\n\nThe example given is reverse_string(s): return s[::-1]. So the answer should be similar.\n\nSo the function would be def add_numbers(a, b): return a + b.\n\nBut the user wants bullet points. Wait, the response should be in bullet points. Wait, the user says \"Respond in bullet points.\" So maybe the answer is a single bullet point with the code.\n\nBut in the context, the example shows a code block. Hmm. Let's see.\n\nThe user says: \"Write a simple function to add two numbers\". The example they provided is a code function. So they want the code for the function.\n\nBut the response must be in bullet points. Wait, perhaps the answer is just a bullet point with the code. Like:\n\n- def add(a, b): return a + b\n\nBut the user says \"precise, directly usable output\". So maybe just the code, but in a bullet point.\n\nWait, the user's instruction says: \"Return precise, directly usable output.\" So the answer should be the code. But they want it in bullet points. Maybe the bullet point is the code.\n\nWait, the example they gave was written as a code block. But the user now says \"Respond in bullet points.\" So perhaps the answer should be a bullet point list with the code.\n\nWait, perhaps the answer is:\n\n- def add(a, b): return a + b\n\nBut maybe they want it without the def line? No, the example has def reverse_string(s): return s[::-1], so the function definition.\n\nAlternatively, in some contexts, people use lambda, but the example uses a named function. The user's example is a named function.\n\nSo the correct response is a bullet point with the function definition.\n\nLet me check: the user says \"Respond in bullet points.\" So the answer should be a single bullet point containing the code.\n\nYes. So the answer is a bullet point with the function code.\n\nSo:\n\n- def add(a, b): return a + b\n\nBut maybe the parameters can be named differently, but the simplest is a and b.\n\nAlternatively, some might use x and y, but a and b is fine.\n\nYes, that's the simplest function.\n</think>\n\n- def add(a, b): return a + b"
