  "output_preview": "<think>\nWe are writing a simple function to add two numbers.\n Constraints: Respond in bullet points.\n\n Since the user wants a concise response in bullet points, I'll write the function in a clear, minimal way.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Define a function that takes two parameters.\n 2. Return the sum.\n\n Example in Python (as it's a common language and simple):\n   def add(a, b):\n        return a + b\n\n However, note: the problem doesn't specify a language, but the context of being a senior engineer and the simplicity suggests a mainstream language.\n\n But the user says: \"Return precise, directly usable output\". So I'll write it as a Python function because it's concise and widely used.\n\n Alternatively, if the user expects a different language, but the problem doesn't specify, I'll assume Python.\n\n Let's write in bullet points:\n\n - Define a function named `add` that takes two arguments: `a` and `b`.\n - The function returns the sum of `a` and `b`.\n\n But the user said: \"Respond in bullet points\". So I'll write:\n\n * `def add(a, b): return a + b`\n\n However, to be precise and directly usable, I'll write the code in a way that's a string of code? But the user says \"directly usable output\", meaning they can copy and run.\n\n Alternatively, the user might want just the code without explanation? But the constraint says \"bullet points\".\n\n Let me re-read: \"Respond in bullet points\". So I have to output bullet points.\n\n I think the best is:\n\n * Function definition: `def add(a, b): return a + b`\n\n But to be even more concise and directly usable, I can write the code in a single line as a string? However, the problem says \"directly usable output\", meaning the user can use it.\n\n Since the user is a senior engineer and wants concise, I'll write:\n\n * `add = lambda a, b: a + b`   (if they want a one-liner) but the problem says \"simple function\", so both are fine.\n\n However, the problem says \"simple function\", so I'll choose the explicit function for clarity.\n\n But note: the problem says \"Write a simple function\". So I'll write the function in a standard way.\n\n Final decision: Output in bullet points with the code.\n\n I think the user expects:\n\n - [Code snippet]\n\n Let me write:\n\n * `def add(a, b): return a + b`\n\n But wait, the problem says \"Respond in bullet points\". So I have to have a bullet point for the code.\n\n Alternatively, if they want the function without the name? But the problem says \"function\".\n\n I think that's it.\n\n However, to be safe, I'll output:\n\n * A simple function to add two numbers: `def add(a, b): return a + b`\n\n But the user said \"bullet points\", so I'll write one bullet point.\n\n Since the problem says \"Constraints: Respond in bullet points\", I'll do:\n\n * `def add(a, b): return a + b`\n\n But note: the problem says \"simple\", so that's simple.\n\n Let me check: is there any constraint on the language? The problem doesn't specify, but in engineering context, Python is common.\n\n Alternatively, if the user is in JavaScript, but the problem doesn't specify.\n\n However, the problem says \"a concise senior engineer\", so I'll assume Python because it's the most common in such contexts for simplicity.\n\n If the user wants another language, they would have specified. So I'll go with Python.\n\n So the response is:\n\n * `def add(a, b): return a + b`\n\n But to be even more concise? The problem says \"precise, directly usable output\". So I can write it as a string that they can copy.\n\n Alternatively, they might want the function in a way that it's a reusable piece of code.\n\n I think the above is direct.\n\n Let's write it.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"Return precise, directly usable output\". So I won't add extra text.\n\n So:\n\n * `def add(a, b): return a + b`\n\n But wait, the problem says \"bullet points\", so I have to have a bullet point. I think that's one bullet point.\n\n Alternatively, if they want multiple bullet points? The problem says \"bullet points\" (plural) but the constraint might be that we have to use bullet points.\n\n I think one bullet point is acceptable.\n\n Let me see the problem: \"Respond in bullet points\". So I'll write one bullet point.\n\n However, to be safe, I can write:\n\n * Function: `def add(a, b): return a + b`\n\n But the problem says \"precise, directly usable output\". So I'll write the code without the extra text.\n\n Final output:\n\n * `def add(a, b): return a + b`\n\n But note: the problem says \"simple function\", and this is simple.\n\n Alternatively, if they want it to be a one-liner without function definition? But the problem says \"function\".\n\n I think that's it.\n\n Let me write the response accordingly.\n</think>\n\n* `def add(a, b): return a + b`"
