  "output_preview": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to aggregate the list [1,2,2,3,3,3] into counts per value. Hmm, so basically, for each number in the list, count how many times it appears. Let me think.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each element. Starting with 1: there's one 1. Then 2 appears twice. Then 3 appears three times. So the counts should be {1:1, 2:2, 3:3}.\n\nWait, the user wants it in a concise way. Maybe as a dictionary or a map. The problem says \"counts per value\", so probably a dictionary where keys are the values and values are the counts.\n\nLet me check if there's any constraint I'm missing. The user mentioned adding a short checklist at the end. So after the output, I need to list a checklist.\n\nWait, the problem says \"Aggregate list [1,2,2,3,3,3] into counts per value.\" So the main output is the counts. Then the checklist.\n\nLet me structure this. The output should be a dictionary-like structure. For example, in Python terms, it would be {1:1, 2:2,  3:3}.\n\nBut the user says \"precise, directly usable output\". So maybe just write it as a JSON object or a simple dict.\n\nWait, the user is a senior engineer, so they might expect a clean, code-like structure. But the problem says \"return precise, directly usable output\". So perhaps just the counts in a dictionary format.\n\nLet me make sure. The list is [1,2,2,3,3,3]. So counts per value:\n\n1: 1 time\n\n2: 2 times\n\n3: 3 times\n\nSo the aggregated counts are {1:1, 2:2, 3:3}.\n\nChecklist: Maybe a short list of steps to verify. Like:\n\n- [x] Count occurrences of each number in the list\n- [x] Verify no duplicates in counts\n- [x] Ensure counts sum to list length (1+2+3=6, which matches list length 6)\n\nBut the user wants a short checklist. Let me keep it concise.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n{1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3}\n\nChecklist:\n- Counted each value's occurrences\n- Verified counts sum to 6\n- No extra values\n\nWait, the user says \"short checklist\". So maybe 2-3 bullet points.\n\nAlternatively, just a list of checks.\n\nBut the user says \"Add a short checklist at the end.\"\n\nSo the final answer should be the counts, then the checklist.\n\nLet me structure it as:\n\n{\"1\": 1, \"2\": 2, \"3\": 3}\n\nWait, but in Python, keys are integers. So probably better to write as {1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3}.\n\nBut the user might expect a code-like output. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, use a JSON string? But the user says \"directly usable output\". As a senior engineer, they might just want the dictionary.\n\nSo the answer is {1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3}\n\nChecklist:\n- [\u2713] Counted occurrences for each unique value\n- [\u2713] Verified total counts sum to 6\n- [\u2713] No missing values in the original list\n\nWait, the list has 1,2,3. So that's correct.\n\nI think that's it. Let me confirm the counts again. Original list: [1,2,2,3,3,3]. So yes, 1 once, 2 twice, 3 three times.\n\nYes. So the output is correct.\n</think>\n\n{1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3}\nChecklist:\n- [\u2713] Counted occurrences per value\n- [\u2713] Total count matches list length (6)\n- [\u2713] No extraneous values"
