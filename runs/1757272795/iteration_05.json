  "output_preview": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to aggregate the list [1,2,2,3,3,3] into counts per value. So first, I need to count how many times each number appears in that list.\n\nStarting with the list: 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3.\n\nLet me go through each number.\n\nFor 1: It appears once. So count is 1.\n\nThen 2: There are two 2s. So count is 2.\n\nNext, 3: There are three 3s. So count is 3.\n\nThe user specified to respond in bullet points. So I should list each value with its count.\n\nWait, the constraints say \"Respond in bullet points.\" So the answer should be in bullet points, each bullet being a value and its count.\n\nLet me double-check the list to make sure I didn't miss any numbers. The original list is [1,2,2,3,3,3]. So the numbers are 1, . 2 appears twice, 3 appears three times. No other numbers. So the counts are correct.\n\nSo the bullet points would be:\n\n- 1: 1\n\n- 2: 2\n\n- 3: 3\n\nBut the user said \"precise, directly usable output\". So maybe just the counts without the labels? Wait, the problem says \"counts per value\", so probably need to specify each value and its count.\n\nIn the example, the user might expect something like:\n\n- 1: 1\n\n- 2: 2\n\n- 3: 3\n\nYes, that's the standard way to present such counts. Let me make sure there's no mistake here. The list has six elements. 1+2+3=6, which matches the length of the list. So the counts are correct.\n\nI think that's it. So the answer should be three bullet points with each value and its count.\n</think>\n\n- 1: 1\n- 2: 2\n- 3: 3"
