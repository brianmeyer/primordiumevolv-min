  "output_preview": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to aggregate the list [1,2,2,3,3,3] into counts per value. So, the user wants each unique value and how many times it appears.\n\nFirst, I'll go through the list step by step. The numbers are 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3.\n\nStarting with 1: there's one occurrence. Then 2 appears twice. Then 3 appears three times. Let me check again to make sure I didn't miss any.\n\nThe list has six elements. 1 once, 2 twice, 3 three times. That adds up to 1+2+3=6, which matches the list length. So the counts are correct.\n\nThe user wants it in bullet points. So each value with its count. Let me format it as:\n\n- 1: 1\n- 2: 2\n- 3: 3\n\nWait, the problem says \"counts per value\", so the answer should list each unique value and the count. Yep, that's exactly what I have here. Let me make sure there's no other numbers. The original list is [1,2,2,3,3,3], so only 1,2,3. \n\nI think that's it. No need for extra text. Just bullet points as per the constraints.\n</think>\n\n- 1: 1\n- 2: 2\n- 3: 3"
