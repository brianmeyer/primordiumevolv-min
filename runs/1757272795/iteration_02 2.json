  "output_preview": "<think>\nWe are given a list: [1,2,2,3,3,3]\n We want to aggregate into counts per value.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We can use a dictionary or a Counter to count the frequency of each number.\n 2. Since the list is small, we can do it manually or with a simple loop.\n\n However, the problem says: \"Aggregate list [1,2,2,3,3,3] into counts per value.\"\n\n Let's do it:\n\n Value 1: appears 1 time\n Value 2: appears 2 times\n Value 3: appears 3 times\n\n So the result should be:\n - 1: 1\n - 2: 2\n - 3: 3\n\n But note: the problem says \"Respond in bullet points\".\n\n We'll write:\n\n * 1: 1\n * 2: 2\n * 3: 3\n\n However, the problem says \"concise\" and \"precise, directly usable output\".\n\n Let's format as:\n\n - 1: 1\n - 2: 2\n - 3: 3\n\n But note: the problem says \"bullet points\". We can use dashes.\n\n Alternatively, we can write in a format that is a dictionary? But the problem says \"bullet points\".\n\n Since the problem says \"Respond in bullet points\", we do:\n\n * 1: 1\n * 2: 2\n * 3: 3\n\n However, the problem says: \"Aggregate list [1,2,2,3,3,3] into counts per value.\"\n\n Let me check: the list has 6 elements.\n\n But note: the problem does not specify the output format beyond bullet points.\n\n We'll output:\n\n - 1: 1\n - 2: 2\n - 3: 3\n\n But wait, the problem says: \"concise senior engineer\". So we don't want extra text.\n\n So the output should be exactly:\n\n- 1: 1\n- 2: 2\n- 3: 3\n\n However, in markdown bullet points, we use asterisks or dashes. The problem says \"bullet points\", so we use dashes for simplicity.\n\n But note: the problem says \"precise, directly usable output\". So we output:\n\n- 1: 1\n- 2: 2\n- 3: 3\n\n Let's write it as:\n\n- 1: 1\n- 2: 2\n- 3: 3\n\n But wait, the problem says: \"Aggregate list [1,2,2,3,3,3]\". We are counting correctly.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"counts per value\". So we are returning the count for each distinct value.\n\n We have three distinct values: 1, 2, 3.\n\n So the output is as above.\n\n But the problem says: \"Return precise, directly usable output\". So we don't add any extra text.\n\n Therefore, the response is:\n\n- 1: 1\n- 2: 2\n- 3: 3\n\n However, the problem says: \"Constraints: Respond in bullet points.\" So we output in bullet points.\n\n Let me write in the required format.\n\n Note: In the response, we are to return only the bullet points without any extra text.\n\n But the problem says: \"You are a concise senior engineer. Return precise, directly usable output.\"\n\n So we output:\n\n- 1: 1\n- 2: 2\n- 3: 3\n\n But wait, the problem says: \"Aggregate list [1,2,2,3,3,3]\". The list has two 2's and three 3's.\n\n However, the problem does not require a specific programming language. We are just outputting.\n\n Let's do it.\n\n Final answer in bullet points:\n\n- 1: 1\n- 2: 2\n- 3: 3\n</think>\n\n- 1: 1\n- 2: 2\n- 3: 3"
