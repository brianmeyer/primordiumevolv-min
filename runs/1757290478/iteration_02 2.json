  "output_preview": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants me to act as a concise senior engineer and summarize key trends to watch for when determining if an AI system is actually learning. They've provided some web context about AI trends from IBM and Forbes, but the main focus is on practical indicators of true learning rather than just listing trends.\n\nHmm, the user is probably a developer or ML engineer who's building an AI system and needs actionable metrics. They might be frustrated with systems that appear to \"learn\" but don't actually generalize well. The phrase \"actually learning\" suggests they care about real-world effectiveness, not just surface-level metrics. \n\nLooking at the constraints - they want bullet points only, no fluff. As a senior engineer, I should focus on observable system behaviors rather than theoretical trends. The web context mentions things like \"augmented working\" and \"real-time decisions\" but those are applications, not learning indicators. \n\nKey angles to cover:\nFirst, performance metrics that change over time - if the system keeps improving without overfitting, that's good. But must emphasize \"sustained improvement\" because most engineers get misled by initial spikes. \n\nSecond, data efficiency. Real learning should show the system using less data than expected for similar tasks. If it's just memorizing, it'll need massive data. \n\nThird, adaptation to new scenarios. The user probably wants to know if the system can handle edge cases they didn't train on. Things like \"does it fail gracefully when inputs change?\" \n\nFourth, explainability. If the system's decisions become less interpretable, it might be overfitting. But should phrase it as \"increasing interpretability\" since that's a positive sign. \n\nWait - the user said \"to know if the system is actually learning\". So I should avoid listing trends like \"AI will dominate jobs\" and focus purely on verification signals. \n\n*checks notes* From engineering perspective: \n- Must mention metrics that track generalization (not just accuracy)\n- Should include failure modes (e.g., how it handles out-of-distribution data)\n- Important to distinguish between \"learning\" and \"memorization\"\n\nI'll structure it as:\n- Sustained performance gains (not just initial boost)\n- Data efficiency metrics\n- Real-world adaptability\n- Explainability trade-offs\n\nUser's probably time-pressed so I'll keep bullets to 4 max. No examples unless asked. \n\n*double-checks* The Forbes piece mentions \"real-time decisions\" but that's an application - not a learning indicator. IBM's \"responsible AI\" angle is relevant for ethical learning but might be too vague. Focus on technical signals instead.\n\nFinal decision: Four bullet points covering measurable, observable behaviors that prove true learning. Avoid jargon like \"generalization\" but use precise terms like \"out-of-distribution performance\".\n</think>\n\n- **Sustained performance gains** (not initial spikes): Track metrics like accuracy, precision, or F1-score over time; true learning shows consistent improvement without plateauing.  \n- **Data efficiency**: Reduced data requirements for similar tasks (e.g., fewer samples needed for new queries) indicates effective pattern recognition vs. memorization.  \n- **Adaptability to novel inputs**: System handles out-of-distribution data and edge cases without catastrophic failure, showing real-world generalization.  \n- **Explainable behavior**: Decisions become more interpretable as the system learns (e.g., clear feature impact), avoiding black-box overfitting."
