  "output_preview": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants me to aggregate the list [1,2,2,3,3,3] into counts per value. They also provided some context about examples and constraints. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the main task is straightforward: count how many times each number appears in that list. The list is [1,2,2,3,3,3]. So I'll go through each number and tally them up.\n\nStarting with 1: there's one occurrence. Then 2 appears twice. And 3 appears three times. So the counts should be 1:1, 2:2, 3:3.\n\nThe user mentioned examples where they analyzed data patterns, like a 20% increase suggesting scaling. But for this specific query, I don't need to add that context since it's about aggregation. The constraints say to respond in bullet points and be concise.\n\nI should make sure my response is direct. No extra fluff. Just the counts in bullet points. Let me structure it as:\n\n- 1: 1\n- 2: 2\n- 3: 3\n\nThat's precise and matches what they need. The user is a senior engineer, so they want the output to be usable without interpretation. I'll avoid any markdown or formatting as per the instructions. Just plain bullet points.\n\nDouble-checking: the list has six elements. 1+2+3=6, so the counts add up correctly. No mistakes there. Alright, this should be the response.\n</think>\n\n- 1: 1\n- 2: 2\n- 3: 3"
