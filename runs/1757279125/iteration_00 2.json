  "output_preview": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to aggregate the list [1,2,2,3,3,3] into counts per value. Let me think. First, I remember that in programming, when you want to count how many times each number appears in a list, you can use a dictionary or a map where the keys are the numbers and the values are the counts.\n\nLet me go through the list step by step. The list is [1,2,2,3,3,3]. Let's see:\n\nStarting with 1: it appears once.\nThen 2: appears twice.\nThen 3: appears three times.\n\nSo the counts per value should be 1:1, 2:2, 3:3.\n\nWait, the problem says \"aggregate list [1,2,2,3,3,3] into counts per value.\" So the output should be a list of tuples or a dictionary with the counts.\n\nBut the user wants the response in bullet points. Let me check the constraints again. Respond in bullet points. So each bullet point is a key-value pair.\n\nWait, the user says \"Aggregate list [...] into counts per value.\" So probably the answer is a list of counts per value. Like:\n\n- 1: 1\n- 2: 2\n- 3: 3\n\nBut maybe they want it in a specific format. Let me make sure.\n\nAnother way: if it's a count per value, then for each unique value, the count. So in the list [1,2,2,3,3,3], unique values are 1,2,3.\n\nSo the counts are 1 once, 2 twice, 3 three times.\n\nSo the bullet points would be:\n\n- 1: 1\n- 2: 2\n- 3: 3\n\nYes, that seems correct. Let me double-check. The list has six elements. 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, which matches the length. So the counts are correct.\n\nI think that's it. So the answer is three bullet points with the value and its count.\n</think>\n\n- 1: 1\n- 2: 2\n- 3: 3"
