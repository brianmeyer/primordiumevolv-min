Hmm, so I need to count how many times each number appears in that list.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each element in the list. Let's list them out:\n\n1 appears once.\nThen 2 appears twice.\nThen 3 appears three times.\n\nSo the counts should be 1:1, 2:2, 3:3.\n\nWait, the user said \"respond in bullet points\". So I need to format this as bullet points. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The list is [1,2,2,3,3,3]. Yep, so 1 once, 2 twice, 3 three times.\n\nI think that's it. Just need to present each value with its count in bullet points.\n</think>\n\n- 1: 1\n- 2: 2\n- 3: 3"
