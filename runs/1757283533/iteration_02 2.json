They specified to respond in bullet points and be concise.\n\nFirst, I need to count how many times each number appears. Let's go through the list step by step.\n\nStarting with 1: there's one 1. Then 2 appears twice. Then 3 appears three times. So the counts should be 1:1, 2:2, 3:3.\n\nWait, the list is [1,2,2,3,3,3]. Let me check again. The first element is 1 (count 1), then two 2s (so count 2 is 2), then three 3s (count 3 is 3). Yep, that's right.\n\nThe user wants bullet points. So I'll write each value with its count. Like:\n\n- 1: 1\n- 2: 2\n- 3: 3\n\nMake sure it's concise. No extra text. Just the bullet points as specified. Let me confirm the constraints again. Respond in bullet points, precise. Yep, that's it.\n</think>\n\n- 1: 1\n- 2: 2\n- 3: 3"
