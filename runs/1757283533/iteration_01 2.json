  "output_preview": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants me to aggregate the list [1,2,2,3,3,3] into counts per value. They also gave examples and constraints about responding in bullet points. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to count how many times each number appears in that list. The list is [1,2,2,3,3,3]. So, for number 1, it appears once. Number 2 appears twice. Number 3 appears three times. \n\nThe user mentioned examples like \"Analyze this data pattern. Pattern shows 20% increase in usage during peak hours...\" but in the context, they want me to just do the aggregation. The constraints say to respond in bullet points, so I should list each value with its count.\n\nWait, the user says \"Aggregate list [1,2,2,3,3,3] into counts per value.\" So the output should be something like:\n- 1: 1\n- 2: 2\n- 3: 3\n\nBut they want it concise and directly usable. Also, the examples show a pattern analysis, but since the user is asking for the aggregation, I should stick to that. The constraints say bullet points, so I'll format it as bullet points without extra text.\n\nI need to make sure it's precise. Let me double-check the counts. The list has six elements: 1, then two 2s, then three 3s. Yep, counts are correct.\n\nSo the response should be:\n- 1: 1\n- 2: 2\n- 3: 3\n\nThat's concise, bullet points, and directly usable. The user didn't ask for any analysis beyond the aggregation, so I shouldn't add extra stuff. The context examples are just for reference but the task is straightforward aggregation.\n</think>\n\n- 1: 1  \n- 2: 2  \n- 3: 3"
