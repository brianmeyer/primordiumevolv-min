  "output_preview": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to compute the mean and median for the list [1,2,3,4,5]. Hmm, first, the mean. The mean is the average, right? So I add up all the numbers and divide by how many there are.\n\nAdding them: 1+2 is 3, plus 3 is 6, plus 4 is 10, plus 5 is 15. So total sum is 15. There are 5 numbers, so 15 divided by 5 is 3. So the mean is 3.\n\nNow the median. The median is the middle value when the list is sorted. Since the list is already sorted, and there are 5 elements (odd number), the median is the third one. Let's count: 1st is 1, 2nd is 2, 3rd is 3. So median is 3.\n\nWait, let me double-check. For even numbers, it's the average of the two middle numbers, but here it's odd, so just the middle. Yep, so median is 3.\n\nSo both mean and median are 3. I need to present them in bullet points. The user wants concise and precise. So the answer should be two bullet points: one for mean, one for median.\n</think>\n\n- Mean: 3  \n- Median: 3"
