  "output_preview": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to compute the mean and median for the list [1,2,3,4,5]. \n\nFirst, the mean. The mean is the average, so I add all the numbers and divide by the count. Let me add them up: 1 + 2 is 3, plus 3 is 6, plus 4 is 10, plus 5 is 15. So total sum is 15. There are 5 numbers, so the mean is 15 divided by 5, which is 3.\n\nNext, the median. The median is the middle value when the list is sorted. Since the list is already sorted, and there are 5 elements (odd number), the median is the third element. The list is [1,2,3,4,5], so the third element is 3. \n\nWait, let me double-check. For median, with odd count n, it's the (n+1)/2 th element. Here n=5, so (5+1)/2 = 3rd element. Yep, that's 3. So median is 3.\n\nSo both mean and median are 3 here. The list is symmetric, so they coincide. \n\nI should present this in bullet points as the user wants. The response should be concise. So:\n\n- Mean: 3\n- Median: 3\n</think>\n\n- Mean: 3  \n- Median: 3"
