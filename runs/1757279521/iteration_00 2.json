  "output_preview": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to compute the mean and median for the list [1,2,3,4,5]. I need to be precise and return bullet points.\n\nFirst, the mean. Mean is the average. So I add all the numbers: 1+2 is 3, plus 3 is 6, plus 4 is 10, plus 5 is 15. Total sum is 15. There are 5 numbers, so 15 divided by 5 is 3. So mean is 3.\n\nMedian is the middle value when the list is sorted. Since the list is already sorted, and there are 5 elements (odd count), the median is the third element. The list is [1,2,3,4,5], so third element is 3. So median is 3.\n\nWait, let me double-check. For median, with odd number of elements, it's the middle one. Yes, 5 elements, index 2 (0-based) is 3. So median is 3.\n\nSo both mean and median are 3 here.\n\nThe user wants bullet points. So I should write:\n\n- Mean: 3\n- Median: 3\n\nBut need to make sure the format is correct. The problem says \"Respond in bullet points.\" So two bullet points, each with the value.\n\nI think that's it. Let me confirm once more. Sum is 15, 15/5=3. Median is third number which is 3. Yep. Looks correct.\n</think>\n\n- Mean: 3  \n- Median: 3"
