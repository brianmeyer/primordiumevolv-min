  "output_preview": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a Python function that checks if a number is prime. Let me think about the constraints first. The user said to respond in bullet points, so I should list the key points concisely.\n\nFirst, primes are numbers greater than 1. So the function should handle numbers less than 2 as non-prime. Then, checking for divisibility up to the square root of the number is efficient. Like, if a number n is prime, it's not divisible by any number from 2 up to sqrt(n). So the loop can go from 2 to int(sqrt(n)) + 1.\n\nWait, but what about even numbers? Like, if the number is even and greater than 2, it's not prime. So maybe adding a quick check for even numbers first can optimize. Like, if n is 2, it's prime. If n is even and not 2, return False.\n\nAlso, the edge cases: 1 is not prime, 2 is prime.\n\nSo the steps for the function:\n\n1. If n < 2: return False.\n\n2. If n == 2: return True.\n\n3. If n is even (n % 2 == 0): return False (since n >2).\n\n4. Check from 3 to sqrt(n) (inclusive) in steps of 2 (odd numbers only). Because even numbers have already been handled.\n\nWait, so the optimized loop starts at 3, increments by 2, and checks up to sqrt(n).\n\nLet me structure the code.\n\nFunction:\n\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n < 2:\n        return False\n    if n == 2:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        return False\n    # Check odd factors up to sqrt(n)\n    i = 3\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 2\n    return True\n\nWait, but what about n=3? Let's test.\n\nn=3: 3 is prime. The loop starts at i=3, i*i=9 >3, so loop doesn't run. Returns True. Good.\n\nn=9: i=3, 3*3=9 <=9. 9%3=0, returns False. Correct.\n\nn=5: i=3, 3*3=9>5, so returns True. Correct.\n\nBut what about n=4? It's even, so handled by step 3. Returns False. Good.\n\nn=1: returns False. Correct.\n\nThis seems to cover the cases. But the user wants the function written in bullet points. Wait, the response should be in bullet points of the function's code or the key steps? Wait, the user says: \"Respond in bullet points.\" So the answer should be bullet points describing the solution.\n\nWait, the problem says \"Write a Python function... Respond in bullet points.\"\n\nSo the assistant should output bullet points that are concise and directly usable. For example, the code as bullet points.\n\nWait, maybe just list the function code in a bullet point. But the user said \"precise, directly usable output\".\n\nHmm, the user says \"Return precise, directly usable output.\" So the response should be bullet points that are the code, but concise.\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\n- Function definition with edge cases handled and optimized loop.\n\nWait, the user wants the answer in bullet points. Let me think.\n\nThe user's instruction: \"Write a Python function to check if a number is prime. Constraints: Respond in bullet points.\"\n\nSo the answer should be bullet points, each bullet point being a part of the solution.\n\nBut the user wants the function. So perhaps the answer is a single bullet point with the code.\n\nWait, but the user says \"Respond in bullet points.\" So the assistant should output a list of bullet points, each containing a part of the solution.\n\nBut the problem says \"Write a Python function...\" so the answer is the code. But the user wants it in bullet points. So maybe one bullet point with the code.\n\nWait, maybe the correct way is to have the code in a code block, but the user says \"Respond in bullet points.\" So perhaps:\n\n- A concise Python function:\n\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n < 2:\n        return False\n    if n == 2:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 3\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 2\n    return True\n\nBut the user says \"Respond in bullet points.\" So the answer should be bullet points, perhaps each line as a bullet point? But that's not standard.\n\nWait, no, the user wants the output to be bullet points. So the assistant's response should be bullet points, each bullet point being a concise step or the code.\n\nWait, maybe the answer is:\n\n- Check if number < 2 \u2192 not prime.\n\n- Handle 2 as prime.\n\n- Skip even numbers >2.\n\n- Loop through odd divisors up to sqrt(n).\n\nBut the user wants a Python function. Hmm. The problem says \"Write a Python function...\", so the answer is the code. The user says to respond in bullet points, so the code can be in one bullet point, perhaps.\n\nWait, the user says \"precise, directly usable output\". So the best way is to present the code in a bullet point.\n\nFor example:\n\n- ```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n < 2:\n        return False\n    if n == 2:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        return False\n    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n```\n\nBut wait, using a for loop might be more efficient than while. Let me check.\n\nIn the code above, the for loop starts from 3, steps by 2, up to sqrt(n).\n\nWait, int(n**0.5) +1 is the upper limit.\n\nFor example, n=25: sqrt(25)=5. The range would be from 3 to 5 (int(5)+1=6), so 3,5. 25%5=0 \u2192 returns False.\n\nYes.\n\nBut in the code, using range(3, int(n**0.5) +1, 2) is correct.\n\nWait, the original code I wrote with while loop is also correct. But using a for loop is more Pythonic.\n\nSo the optimized code:\n\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n < 2:\n        return False\n    if n == 2:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        return False\n    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\nBut let's check n=3: sqrt(3) ~1.732, so int(1.732) +1 = 2. The range is range(3, 2, 2) which is empty. So returns True. Correct.\n\nn=5: sqrt(5) ~2.236, int(2.236)=2, +1=3. So range(3,3,2) is empty. Returns True.\n\nn=9: sqrt(9)=3, int(3)+1=4. So range(3,4,2) \u2192 [3]. 9%3=0 \u2192 returns False. Correct.\n\nSo the for loop version is correct.\n\nAlternatively, using while loop is also correct, but for loop is more concise.\n\nSo the bullet point would be the code.\n\nBut the user says \"Respond in bullet points.\" So perhaps one bullet point with the code.\n\nWait, the user said \"Return precise, directly usable output.\" So the answer is a code block in a bullet point.\n\nBut the user wants the response to be in bullet points. Let me write:\n\n- Python function:\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n < 2:\n        return False\n    if n == 2:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        return False\n    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n```\n\nBut the user said \"Respond in bullet points.\" So maybe this is the answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can be written more concisely by combining checks.\n\nBut the user wants precise and directly usable.\n\nAnother point: the case when n=2 is handled, and even numbers.\n\nYes, the code above is correct.\n\nWait, in Python, using range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2) \u2014 but for n=4, which is even, the code returns False. For n=2, it returns True. For n=1, returns False.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the bullet point is this code.\n\nSo the answer should be a bullet point containing the code.\n\nWait, the user says \"Respond in bullet points.\" So maybe multiple bullet points.\n\nBut the problem says \"Write a Python function...\", so the answer is one function. So one bullet point with the code.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the response is:\n\n- `def is_prime(n): return n < 2 or n == 2 or n % 2 == 0 and n % i == 0 for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2)` \u2014 no, that's not helpful.\n\nWait, no, the code as I wrote before.\n\nSo the correct answer is the code as a bullet point.\n\nI think the best way is to present the code in a code block inside a bullet point.\n\nBut the user wants concise. Let me check.\n\nAlternative code: using a list comprehension or other methods, but for clarity, the above is good.\n\nSo the bullet point is:\n\n- ```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n < 2:\n        return False\n    if n == 2:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        return False\n    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n```\n\nYes. But the user said \"precise, directly usable output\". So this code is correct and efficient.\n\nWait, another edge case: n=1. The function returns False, which is correct.\n\nn=2 returns True.\n\nn=3 returns True.\n\nn=4 returns False.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should be correct.\n\nSo the answer is a bullet point with the code.\n</think>\n\n- ```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n < 2:\n        return False\n    if n == 2:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        return False\n    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n```"
