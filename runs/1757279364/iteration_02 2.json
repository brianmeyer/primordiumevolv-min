  "output_preview": "<think>\nWe are given a sample CSV data inline. However, note that the problem says \"Assume data is provided inline\", but the user did not provide the CSV in the query.\n Since the problem states: \"Filter rows where age > 30 from a sample CSV and count them\", and the constraints say to respond in bullet points, I must assume that the user intended to provide the CSV but forgot.\n\n But the problem says: \"Respond in bullet points\". And the instruction: \"Return precise, directly usable output.\"\n\n Without the actual CSV data, I cannot perform the task.\n\n However, the problem says: \"Assume data is provided inline\". Since it's not, I have to note that.\n\n But wait, the user's message does not have the CSV. So I must respond appropriately.\n\n Given the constraints, I think the best is to state that the CSV data is missing.\n\n Alternatively, if the problem intended for me to use a standard sample, but it doesn't specify.\n\n Since the problem says: \"Filter rows where age > 30 from a sample CSV\", and without the data, I cannot.\n\n Let me re-read: \"Assume data is provided inline\". The user did not provide it.\n\n Therefore, I will output:\n\n - The CSV data is missing in the query.\n\n But the problem says: \"Return precise, directly usable output\". And in bullet points.\n\n However, the problem says: \"Filter rows ... and count them\". Without data, we can't.\n\n I think the intended response is to note the missing data.\n\n But note: the problem says \"a sample CSV\", so maybe they expect a generic solution? But the constraints say to be concise and directly usable.\n\n Alternatively, if the problem is a thought experiment, but the instruction says \"Assume data is provided inline\", meaning that in a real scenario the data would be there. Since it's not, we have to point out.\n\n Since the problem states: \"Respond in bullet points\", I'll do:\n\n - CSV data not provided in the query.\n\n However, the problem might have been intended to have the data. But the user didn't write it.\n\n Let me check the user's message: \"Filter rows where age > 30 from a sample CSV and count them. Assume data is provided inline.\"\n\n There is no inline data.\n\n Therefore, I must respond that the data is missing.\n\n But note: the problem says \"a sample CSV\", so perhaps they mean to use a common sample? However, the problem says \"Assume data is provided inline\", meaning that in the context of the problem the data is given. Since it's not, I have to say it's missing.\n\n Given the constraints, I'll write:\n\n - Missing CSV data in the query.\n\n However, the problem says: \"Return precise, directly usable output\". This response is precise and directly usable (by the user to know the issue).\n\n Alternatively, if the problem expects a code example? But the problem says \"count them\", so we are to do the count.\n\n But without data, we can't.\n\n I think the safe response is:\n\n - CSV data not provided.\n\n Let's do it in bullet points as requested.\n\n Final response:\n\n- CSV data is missing in the query.\n</think>\n\n- CSV data not provided in the query."
