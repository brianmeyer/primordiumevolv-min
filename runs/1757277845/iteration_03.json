  "output_preview": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to compute the mean and median for the list [1,2,3,4,5]. \n\nFirst, the mean. The mean is the average, so I add all the numbers and divide by the count. Let me add them up: 1+2 is 3, plus 3 is 6, plus 4 is 10, plus 5 is 15. There are 5 numbers, so 15 divided by 5 is 3. So the mean is 3.\n\nNext, the median. The median is the middle value when the list is sorted. Since the list is already sorted, and there are 5 elements (odd count), the median is the third number. The list is [1,2,3,4,5], so the third element is 3. Therefore, the median is also 3.\n\nWait, let me double-check. For the median in an odd-length list, yes, it's the middle index. Index 2 (0-based) would be 3. So that's correct.\n\nSo both mean and median are 3. The answer should be two bullet points: one for mean, one for median.\n</think>\n\n- Mean: 3\n- Median: 3"
