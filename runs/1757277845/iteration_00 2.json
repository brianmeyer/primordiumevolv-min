  "output_preview": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to compute the mean and median for the list [1,2,3,4,5]. Let me think.\n\nFirst, the mean. The mean is the average, right? So I add up all the numbers and divide by how many there are. The list has 5 numbers. Let me add them: 1+2 is 3, plus 3 is 6, plus 4 is 10, plus 5 is 15. So total sum is 15. Then divide by 5: 15/5 = 3. So mean is 3.\n\nNow the median. The median is the middle number when the list is sorted. Since the list is already sorted in ascending order, that's good. For a list with odd number of elements (5 here), the median is the third element. Let's count: 1st is 1, 2nd is 2, 3rd is 3. So median is 3.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Sometimes people get confused with even numbers, but here it's odd. So yes, third element. So median is 3.\n\nSo both mean and median are 3 here. The problem says to provide both values in bullet points. So the answer should be:\n\n- Mean: 3\n- Median: 3\n\nI think that's it. Let me just confirm once more. Sum is 15, divided by 5 is 3. Sorted list, middle is 3. Yep, correct.\n</think>\n\n- Mean: 3\n- Median: 3"
