  "output_preview": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to compute the mean and median for the list [1,2,3,4,5] and provide both values. They also mentioned to respond in bullet points, like the examples they gave.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the mean. The mean is the average. So I add up all the numbers: 1+2 is 3, plus 3 is 6, plus 4 is 10, plus 5 is 15. Then divide by the count, which is 5. So 15 divided by 5 is 3. So the mean is 3.\n\nNext, the median. The median is the middle value when the list is sorted. Since the list is already sorted, and there are 5 numbers, the middle one is the third number. Let's count: 1 (1st), 2 (2nd), 3 (3rd), 4 (4th), 5 (5th). So the median is 3.\n\nWait, the user said \"provide both values\". So I need to list them as bullet points. The example shows components as bullet points, but here it's the mean and median. So the response should be two bullet points: one for mean, one for median.\n\nLet me check again. Mean is (1+2+3+4+5)/5 = 15/5 = 3. Median is 3. Yep, that's correct.\n\nThe constraints say respond in bullet points. So I'll write:\n\n- Mean: 3\n- Median: 3\n\nThat's concise and directly usable. No extra text.\n</think>\n\n- Mean: 3  \n- Median: 3"
