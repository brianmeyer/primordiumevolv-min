  "output_preview": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to compute the mean and median for the list [1,2,3,4,5]. I need to be precise and return both values in bullet points.\n\nFirst, the mean. Mean is the average. So I add up all the numbers and divide by how many there are. Let's calculate that. 1+2 is 3, plus 3 is 6, plus 4 is 10, plus 5 is 15. Total sum is 15. There are 5 numbers. So mean is 15 divided by 5, which is 3. So mean is 3.\n\nNext, the median. Median is the middle value when the list is sorted. Since the list is already sorted (1,2,3,4,5), and there are 5 elements, the median is the third number. So the third number is 3. So median is 3.\n\nWait, let me double-check. For odd number of elements, the median is the middle one. Yes, 5 elements, so index 2 (0-based) which is 3. Correct.\n\nSo both mean and median are 3 here.\n\nThe user wants bullet points. So I should write:\n\n- Mean: 3\n- Median: 3\n\nBut the instructions say \"precise, directly usable output\". So concise. Let me make sure. The list is [1,2,3,4,5], so sorted, yes. Sum is 15, mean 3. Median is 3. Yep.\n\nNo other constraints. So bullet points as instructed.\n</think>\n\n- Mean: 3\n- Median: 3"
