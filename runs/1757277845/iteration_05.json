  "output_preview": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to compute the mean and median for the list [1,2,3,4,5]. Let me think.\n\nFirst, the mean. The mean is the average, right? So I add up all the numbers and divide by how many there are. Let's see, adding them up: 1+2 is 3, plus 3 is 6, plus 4 is 10, plus 5 is 15. So total sum is 15. There are 5 numbers, so 15 divided by 5 is 3. So the mean should be 3.\n\nNow the median. The median is the middle number when the list is sorted. But wait, the list is already sorted here: [1,2,3,4,5]. Since there are 5 elements, the median is the third one. Let me count: first is 1, second 2, third 3. So median is 3.\n\nWait, let me double-check. For an odd number of observations, median is the middle value. Yes, so 3 is correct.\n\nSo both mean and median are 3 here. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Sum is 15, 15/5=3. Correct. Sorted list, middle index is (5-1)/2 = 2, so index 2 (0-based) is 3. Yep. So both are 3.\n\nThe user wants bullet points. So the answer should be two bullet points: one for mean, one for median.\n</think>\n\n- Mean: 3  \n- Median: 3"
