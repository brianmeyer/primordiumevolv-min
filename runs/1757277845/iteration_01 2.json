  "output_preview": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to compute the mean and median for the list [1,2,3,4,5]. \n\nFirst, the mean. The mean is the average, so I add all the numbers and divide by the count. Let's add them up: 1+2 is 3, plus 3 is 6, plus 4 is 10, plus 5 is 15. So total sum is 15. There are 5 numbers, so 15 divided by 5 is 3. So the mean is 3.\n\nNow the median. The median is the middle value when the list is ordered. Since the list is already in order, and there are 5 elements (odd count), the median is the third number. Let's count: first is 1, second 2, third 3. So median is 3.\n\nWait, that's interesting. Both mean and median are 3 here. Let me double-check. For the list [1,2,3,4,5], sorted, yes. The median for odd n is the (n+1)/2 th term. So (5+1)/2 = 3rd term, which is 3. Mean is (1+2+3+4+5)/5 = 15/5 = 3. Yep, correct.\n\nSo the answer should be mean: 3, median: 3.\n</think>\n\n- Mean: 3\n- Median: 3"
