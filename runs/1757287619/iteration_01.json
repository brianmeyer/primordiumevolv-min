  "output_preview": "<think>\nHmm, the user is asking about the year the United States declared independence. They want a concise response in bullet points as a senior engineer would provide. \n\nFirst, I recall that the United States declared independence on July 4, 1776 with the Declaration of Independence. That's the key date. But the user specifically asked for the year, so I should focus on 1776.\n\nThe constraints say to respond in bullet points. Since it's a single fact, I'll make it one bullet point to keep it precise. No need for extra fluff - as a senior engineer, I'd prioritize accuracy and brevity.\n\nI wonder if they're testing historical knowledge or just need quick info. Either way, sticking to the facts without elaboration fits the \"concise senior engineer\" role. \n\nBetter double-check: Yes, 1776 is correct. The Continental Congress approved it in July 1776, though it was formally signed later. But the declaration year is universally 1776.\n\nFinal decision: One bullet point stating \"1776\" directly. No explanations, no context - just what they asked for.\n</think>\n\n- 1776"
