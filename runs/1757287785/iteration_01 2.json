  "output_preview": "<think>\nOkay, the user is asking about Albert Einstein's birth year. This seems straightforward but I need to be careful since the user specified \"careful analyst\" and \"trace reasoning in brief steps\" with bullet points. \n\nFirst, I recall Einstein was born in 1879 - that's basic historical fact. But let me mentally verify: His most famous paper was 1905 (annus mirabilis), he died in 1955, so 1879 fits. I should confirm the exact date too - March 14, 1879 in Ulm, Germany. \n\nHmm, the user wants constraints: respond in bullet points only. No extra text. So I'll structure it as: \n- Start with direct answer (1879) \n- Then one bullet for why it's correct (historical record) \n- One bullet for precision (date and location) \n- Avoid overcomplicating since user said \"brief steps\" \n\nWait - is there any chance of confusion? Like some people think he was born in 1880? No, all reliable sources say 1879. I'll skip that potential confusion since user didn't ask for caveats. \n\nUser seems to want academic rigor but simple format. Maybe they're testing if I'll overthink? I'll keep it clean: just the facts they need. \n\nFinal structure: \n- Year: 1879 \n- Reason: Consistent historical records \n- Precision: Full date/location for context \n\nNo need for sources unless asked. User said \"confirm assumptions\" so I'll imply the assumption (that historical records are reliable) is valid without saying it explicitly. \n\n*checks mental notes* Yep, Encyclopedia Britannica, NASA, all standard references say 1879. Solid.\n</think>\n\n- Albert Einstein was born in 1879.  \n- This year is confirmed by consistent historical records, including primary sources like Einstein's birth certificate and verified biographies.  \n- His exact birth date was March 14, 1879, in Ulm, Germany."
