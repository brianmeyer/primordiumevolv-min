  "output_preview": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants me to write a function to add two numbers. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the constraints say to respond in bullet points. So I need to structure the answer as bullet points, not a paragraph. The user specified that I'm a concise senior engineer, so the output should be precise and directly usable.\n\nHmm, the function to add two numbers is a basic task. But I should make sure it's efficient and handles edge cases. Wait, the user didn't specify programming language, but since they want a function, I'll pick a common one like Python. Maybe they expect a general solution, but in practice, functions are language-specific.\n\nWait, the problem says \"write a function\", so I need to provide code. But the response should be in bullet points. Let me think: the user wants bullet points, each bullet point being a concise part of the answer.\n\nWait, the user's instruction says \"Respond in bullet points.\" So the entire response should be bullet points. Let me outline:\n\n- First bullet: The function in Python (since it's a common language for such examples)\n- Maybe mention that it's a simple function, but the user might want to know about edge cases? Wait, the constraints don't specify edge cases, but as a senior engineer, I should consider minimal edge cases. But the user said \"precise, directly usable output\". So maybe just the basic function.\n\nWait, the user's example says \"Respond in bullet points.\" So each bullet point is a line of code or a key point.\n\nWait, maybe the user wants the function definition as the main point. Let me think.\n\nFor example:\n\n- `def add(a, b): return a + b`\n\nBut maybe they want it in a specific context. Wait, the problem says \"add two numbers\", so the function takes two parameters.\n\nWait, but the user might be expecting a more robust solution, but the constraints say to be concise. So the minimal function.\n\nWait, in Python, the simplest way is just a + b.\n\nBut the user said \"a concise senior engineer\", so the answer should be precise. Let me check.\n\nThe user's instruction says \"Return precise, directly usable output.\" So the answer should be a bullet point with the code.\n\nWait, the problem says \"Respond in bullet points.\" So the response is a list of bullet points. But the user wants the function written.\n\nHmm, maybe the answer is a single bullet point with the function"
