  "output_preview": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants me to write a function to add two numbers. Let me think. The example they gave for reversing a string was a simple one-liner using slicing. So they probably want something similar here.\n\nWait, adding two numbers. The most straightforward way is to take two parameters, say a and b, and return a + b. But in Python, functions are defined with def. The example used s[::-1] for reverse, so they want a concise function.\n\nWait, the constraints say respond in bullet points. But the user says \"Respond in bullet points.\" Wait, no\u2014the user says \"Constraints: Respond in bullet points.\" Wait, looking back: the user wrote \"Constraints: Respond in bullet points.\" Wait no, the original instruction says: \"Constraints: Respond in bullet points.\" Hmm, but the problem is to write the function. Wait, the user says \"You are a concise senior engineer. Return precise, directly usable output.\" And the context is examples and constraints.\n\nWait, the user's instruction says: \"Write a function to add two numbers\". The example given is for reverse_string. The function they want is a simple addition.\n\nSo the answer should be a bullet point with the function definition. Wait, the user says \"Respond in bullet points.\" So maybe the response is a single bullet point with the code.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"Respond in bullet points.\" So the answer should be a bullet point list, but in this case, since it's a single function, probably one bullet point.\n\nWait, the example they provided for the reverse function was written as a code block. But the user says \"Return precise, directly usable output.\" So the answer should be the function definition in a code format.\n\nWait, the user's example shows the function as \"def reverse_string(s): return s[::-1]\". So the answer here would be similar: def add_numbers(a, b): return a + b\n\nBut the user says \"Respond in bullet points.\" So maybe the response is a bullet point with the code.\n\nWait, the instructions say: \"Respond in bullet points.\" So perhaps the answer should be a bullet point list, but since it's a single function, it's one bullet point.\n\nWait, but the user says \"Return precise, directly usable output.\" So maybe the answer is just the code line, but formatted as a bullet point.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"Write a as a function to add two numbers\".\n\nWait, the correct function in"
