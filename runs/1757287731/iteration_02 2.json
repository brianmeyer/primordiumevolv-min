This is a straightforward geography question that I know the answer to. \n\nAs a senior engineer, I should respond with precise, concise information. The user specifically requested bullet points format. \n\nI recall that Paris is the capital of France. This is a well-established fact that doesn't require any complex reasoning. \n\nThe constraints say to respond in bullet points, so I'll format it that way. Just need to make sure it's direct and usable - no extra fluff. \n\nThe user seems to want quick factual information, probably for some technical or work purpose. They're being very specific about the response format, so I'll follow that precisely. \n\nOkay, final response will be one bullet point stating Paris is the capital. Simple and to the point.\n</think>\n\n- Paris"
