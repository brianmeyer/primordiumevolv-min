  "output_preview": "<think>\nHmm, the user is asking about the capital of France. They want a concise response in bullet points as a senior engineer would provide. \n\nThis is a straightforward geography fact that I know offhand - Paris is the capital. Since they specified \"precise, directly usable output\" and \"bullet points\", I shouldn't add any extra fluff. \n\nThe constraints are clear: must be bullet points only, no explanations. I recall that in professional contexts, engineers often use bullet points for quick reference. \n\nI'll just output the single bullet point with the answer. No need to mention anything about France or capitals since the user wants extreme conciseness. \n\n*checks mental database* Yes, definitely Paris. No recent changes to this fact. \n\nUser seems to want this for quick reference - maybe they're in a hurry or building some system that needs this data point. The \"senior engineer\" framing suggests they value precision over elaboration. \n\nFinal decision: one bullet point stating Paris. Strictly following their format request.\n</think>\n\n- Paris"
