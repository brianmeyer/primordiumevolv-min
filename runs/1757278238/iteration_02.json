  "output_preview": "<think>\nHmm, the user wants me to summarize a specific paragraph in one sentence, but with constraints that I must respond in bullet points. That's a bit tricky because bullet points are typically for multiple items, but they specified \"one sentence\" in the summary. \n\nLooking at the paragraph: 'PrimordiumEvolv introduces a self-evolving system that blends local generation with rigorous evaluation to steadily improve.' It's describing a system called PrimordiumEvolv that has self-evolving capabilities. The key points are: it's self-evolving, combines local generation with evaluation, and aims for steady improvement.\n\nThe user is a senior engineer who wants concise output. They emphasized \"precise, directly usable\" so I shouldn't add fluff. Also, they said \"respond in bullet points\" but the summary should be one sentence. I need to interpret this carefully. \n\nFor bullet points, I could make it a single bullet point containing the one-sentence summary. That way, it's still bullet points but only one item. The constraint says \"bullet points\" plural, but since it's one sentence, I'll do one bullet point to stay precise. \n\nI'll craft it tightly: Start with the system name, then the core mechanism (blending local generation with evaluation), and the outcome (steady improvement). Avoid jargon, keep it engineer-friendly. \n\nUser might be testing if I follow instructions strictly\u2014no markdown, just plain text. They're probably in a hurry, so I'll make it super short. \n\nFinal decision: One bullet point with the sentence. That meets \"one sentence\" and \"bullet points\" (even if singular). \n\n*Double-checking*: Is \"self-evolving\" redundant? No, it's key. \"Blends\" is better than \"combines\" for tech context. \"Steadily improve\" \u2192 \"steadily improves\" for active voice? Wait, the original says \"to steadily improve\" so it's purpose. I'll use present tense for consistency with the system's ongoing action. \n\nOkay, bullet point ready: \"Primord:Evolve's self-evolving system integrates local generation with rigorous evaluation to steadily improve.\"\n</think>\n\n- PrimordiumEvolv's self-evolving system integrates local generation with rigorous evaluation to steadily improve."
