  "output_preview": "Here are some examples of self-evolving architectures:\n\n**Code Rewrite and Refactoring:**\n\n* **Gradual Code Replacement**: Gradually replace outdated code with new, improved versions, ensuring minimal disruption to the system.\n* **Code Merging and Splitting**: Merge or split codebases to improve maintainability, readability, and performance.\n* **Modularization**: Break down monolithic code into smaller, independent modules to reduce complexity and improve maintainability.\n\n**Model Retraining and Updating:**\n\n* **Online Learning**: Retrain models on new data as it arrives, updating the model's parameters to adapt to changing conditions.\n* **Transfer Learning**: Use pre-trained models as a starting point, fine-tuning them on new data to adapt to changing conditions.\n* **Model Averaging**: Combine predictions from multiple models to improve overall accuracy and adapt to changing conditions.\n\n**LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) and Adapter Models:**\n\n* **LoRA**: Add a low-rank adaptation layer to a pre-trained model to adapt to new tasks or domains.\n* **Adapter Models**: Use adapter layers to modify a pre-trained model's behavior without changing its underlying weights or architecture.\n\n**Self-Modifying Code:**\n\n* **Meta-Learning**: Train models to learn how to learn, allowing them to adapt to new tasks or domains without requiring significant retraining.\n* **Evolutionary Algorithms**: Use evolutionary algorithms to search for optimal model configurations or architectures.\n\n**Other Techniques:**\n\n* **Automatic Model Selection**: Use automated techniques to select the best model or architecture for a given task or dataset.\n* **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Use automated techniques to optimize model hyperparameters for improved performance.\n* **Model Pruning**: Remove unnecessary model components or weights to improve performance and reduce computational costs."
