  "output_preview": "- **Continuous Refactoring Pipelines**  \n  - *What*: Automated CI/CD jobs that run static analysis (e.g., SonarQube) and trigger code\u2011rewrite bots (e.g., OpenAI Codex, GitHub Copilot) to replace anti\u2011patterns.  \n  - *Why*: Keeps codebase low\u2011technical\u2011debt without manual review cycles.  \n\n- **Neural Architecture Search (NAS) for Model Evolution**  \n  - *What*: Scheduler launches a NAS job (e.g., Google AutoML, Microsoft NNI) whenever validation loss plateaus; best discovered architecture is automatically container\u2011ized and promoted.  \n  - *Why*: Model structure adapts to new data distributions without human design.  \n\n- **LoRA\u2011Based Incremental Fine\u2011Tuning**  \n  - *What*: Deploy a base LLM; on new domain data, compute low\u2011rank adapters (LoRA) and merge them at runtime via a lightweight adapter server.  \n  - *Why*: Enables rapid specialization with minimal compute and storage overhead.  \n\n- **Self\u2011Supervised Data Augmentation Loop**  \n  - *What*: Production logs are fed to a data\u2011labeling microservice that generates pseudo\u2011labels (e.g., via teacher\u2011student distillation); the augmented set retrains the model nightly.  \n  - *Why*: Model continuously learns from real\u2011world usage patterns.  \n\n- **Online Reinforcement Learning (RL) for Autoscaling**  \n  - *What*: RL agent observes metrics (CPU, request latency) and issues scaling actions; policy updates nightly using collected reward signals.  \n  - *Why*: System automatically optimizes resource allocation as traffic patterns shift.  \n\n- **Meta\u2011Learning Optimizer (e.g., MAML) for Rapid Retraining**  \n  - *What*: Train a meta\u2011learner on a distribution of tasks; when a new task appears (new feature set), perform a few gradient steps to adapt the model.  \n  - *Why*: Drastically reduces time\u2011to\u2011accuracy for emerging use\u2011cases.  \n\n- **Versioned Model Registry with Automated Canary Promotion**  \n  - *What*: New model artifacts (including LoRA adapters) are registered; a canary deployment runs A/B tests, and a policy engine auto\u2011promotes the version that meets SLA thresholds.  \n  - *Why*: Guarantees safe, data\u2011driven rollout of evolved models.  \n\n- **Self\u2011Healing Code Generation via Observability Feedback**  \n  - *What*: Runtime exception traces are sent to an LLM that proposes patches; PRs are auto\u2011created, CI runs, and if green, the patch merges.  \n  - *Why*: Reduces MTTR by turning observed failures into code fixes.  \n\n- **Dynamic Feature Store Evolution**  \n  - *What*: Feature engineering notebooks export transformations as SQL/Scala; a scheduler detects drift in feature distributions and auto\u2011generates new feature candidates (e.g., interaction terms) for downstream retraining.  \n  - *Why*: Keeps feature set aligned with evolving data without manual scouting.  \n\n- **Federated LoRA Updates for Edge Devices**  \n  - *What*: Edge nodes compute LoRA deltas locally on user data; deltas are aggregated securely (e.g., via Secure Aggregation) and merged into the central model.  \n  - *Why*: Improves personalization while preserving privacy and limiting bandwidth.
