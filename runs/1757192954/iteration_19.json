  "output_preview": "* **Code Rewriting**: Self-evolving architectures can involve rewriting code to improve performance, readability, or maintainability, such as:\n  * Automated code refactoring tools like Resharper or SonarQube that suggest improvements to code structure and syntax\n  * Code review processes that identify areas for improvement and implement changes\n  * Continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines that automate testing, building, and deployment of code changes\n* **Neural Architecture Search (NAS)**: NAS involves using machine learning algorithms to search for optimal neural network architectures, such as:\n  * Reinforcement learning-based NAS, which uses rewards to guide the search process\n  * Evolutionary algorithm-based NAS, which uses principles of natural selection to evolve architectures\n  * Gradient-based NAS, which uses gradient descent to optimize architecture parameters\n* **Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)**: LoRA is a technique for adapting pre-trained language models to new tasks or domains, such as:\n  * LoRA-based fine-tuning, which updates a subset of model weights to adapt to a new task or domain\n  * LoRA-based meta-learning, which learns to adapt to new tasks or domains using a few examples\n* **Retraining and Fine-Tuning**: Self-evolving architectures can involve retraining or fine-tuning models on new data or tasks, such as:\n  * Transfer learning, which involves fine-tuning a pre-trained model on a new task or dataset\n  * Online learning, which involves updating a model in real-time as new data arrives\n  * Meta-learning, which involves learning to learn from a few examples and adapting to new tasks or domains\n* **Generative Models**: Generative models can be used to generate new architectures or adapt existing ones, such as:\n  * Generative adversarial networks (GANs), which can generate new architectures by competing with a discriminator network\n  * Variational autoencoders (VAEs), which can generate new architectures by sampling from a latent space\n* **Evolutionary Algorithms**: Evolutionary algorithms can be used to evolve architectures over time, such as:\n  * Genetic algorithms, which use principles of natural selection and genetics to evolve architectures\n  * Evolution strategies, which use a population of candidate solutions to evolve architectures\n* **Self-Modifying Code**: Self-modifying code can be used to evolve architectures by modifying the code itself, such as:\n  * Self-modifying neural networks, which can modify their own architecture or weights during execution\n  * Genetic programming, which uses evolutionary algorithms to evolve programs or code snippets."
