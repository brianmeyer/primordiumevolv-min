  "output_preview": "* **Code Rewriting**: \n  * Example: Refactor duplicated code into reusable functions.\n  * Issue: Code duplication, maintainability issues. \n  * Solution: Extract common logic into separate, testable functions.\n* **Automated Refactoring**:\n  * Example: Rename variables for clarity.\n  * Issue: Unclear variable names, decreased readability. \n  * Solution: Utilize IDE tools or scripts to rename variables based on usage and context.\n* **Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)**:\n  * Example: Adapt pre-trained language models to new tasks or datasets.\n  * Issue: Models require significant retraining for new tasks. \n  * Solution: Apply LoRA to update model weights efficiently, leveraging pre-trained knowledge.\n* **Model Retraining**:\n  * Example: Update a classifier to recognize new classes.\n  * Issue: Model performance degrades on new, unseen data. \n  * Solution: Retrain the model on a combined dataset of old and new classes, incorporating techniques like transfer learning or online learning.\n* **Neural Architecture Search (NAS)**:\n  * Example: Automatically search for optimal neural network architectures.\n  * Issue: Manual architecture design is time-consuming and suboptimal. \n  * Solution: Utilize NAS algorithms to search for architectures that maximize performance on a given task.\n* **Self-Modifying Code**:\n  * Example: Generate code at runtime based on input or performance metrics.\n  * Issue: Static codebases are inflexible and inefficient for dynamic environments. \n  * Solution: Implement self-modifying code techniques, such as just-in-time compilation or meta-programming, to adapt code to changing conditions.\n* **Evolutionary Algorithms**:\n  * Example: Use genetic programming to evolve better solutions.\n  * Issue: Traditional optimization methods converge to local optima. \n  * Solution: Apply evolutionary algorithms, which use principles of natural selection and mutation to search for optimal solutions in complex spaces."
