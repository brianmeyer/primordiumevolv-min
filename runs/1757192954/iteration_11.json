  "output_preview": "* **Automated Code Refactoring**: Tools like SonarQube or Resharper can analyze codebases and suggest improvements, such as renaming variables, removing dead code, or optimizing loops.\n* **Genetic Programming**: Techniques like genetic algorithms can be used to evolve code by iteratively applying mutations, crossovers, and selection to improve performance or reduce complexity.\n* **Neural Architecture Search (NAS)**: NAS uses reinforcement learning or evolutionary algorithms to search for optimal neural network architectures, such as modifying layer structures or connection patterns.\n* **Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)**: LoRA is a technique for adapting pre-trained language models to new tasks or domains by updating a low-rank matrix, allowing for efficient and effective transfer learning.\n* **Online Learning**: Online learning algorithms, such as incremental SVM or online gradient descent, can update models in real-time as new data arrives, allowing for continuous evolution and adaptation.\n* **Meta-Learning**: Meta-learning algorithms, such as Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML), can learn to adapt to new tasks or environments by training on a set of related tasks and fine-tuning on new tasks.\n* **Retraining and Fine-Tuning**: Periodically retraining models on new data or fine-tuning pre-trained models on specific tasks can help adapt to changing distributions or improve performance over time.\n* **Evolutionary Hyperparameter Optimization**: Techniques like Bayesian optimization or evolutionary algorithms can be used to evolve hyperparameters, such as learning rates or batch sizes, to improve model performance.\n* **Self-Modifying Code**: Self-modifying code, such as code that rewrites its own implementation or generates new code at runtime, can be used to create adaptive systems that evolve in response to changing conditions."
