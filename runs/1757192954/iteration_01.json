  "output_preview": "- **Genetic Programming / Evolutionary Algorithms** \u2013 programs are represented as trees; mutation and crossover operators automatically rewrite and improve code over generations.  \n- **Neural Architecture Search (NAS)** \u2013 controller RNN or reinforcement\u2011learning agent proposes network topologies; the best candidates are trained, evaluated, and fed back to refine the search.  \n- **Meta\u2011Learning (MAML, Reptile)** \u2013 a model learns to adapt quickly to new tasks; the base weights are continuously updated as new data/tasks arrive, effectively \u201crewriting\u201d its own learning strategy.  \n- **Continuous Integration + Automated Refactoring** \u2013 CI pipelines run static analysis tools (e.g., RefactorBot, DeepCode) that suggest and apply code transformations, then run tests to validate the rewrite.  \n- **Self\u2011Modifying Code / JIT Optimizers** \u2013 runtime systems (e.g., LLVM\u2019s MCJIT, PyPy) profile hot paths and emit optimized machine code on\u2011the\u2011fly, replacing the original implementation.  \n- **LoRA (Low\u2011Rank Adaptation) Fine\u2011Tuning** \u2013 a frozen large language model is extended with low\u2011rank weight updates; new LoRA modules are added for each task, allowing the base model to evolve without full retraining.  \n- **Continual / Incremental Learning** \u2013 models are updated with streaming data using techniques like Elastic Weight Consolidation or replay buffers, preventing catastrophic forgetting while the architecture adapts.  \n- **AutoML Pipelines (TPOT, AutoKeras)** \u2013 end\u2011to\u2011end pipelines that automatically select preprocessing, model type, hyperparameters, and even feature engineering steps; each run rewrites the pipeline based on performance feedback.  \n- **Reinforcement\u2011Learning\u2011Based Code Generation (e.g., Codex, AlphaCode)** \u2013 agents generate, test, and iteratively improve code snippets, effectively evolving software through trial\u2011and\u2011error loops.  \n- **Dynamic Graph Neural Networks** \u2013 the graph structure (nodes/edges) is updated during training based on learned importance scores, allowing the network topology to evolve as data changes.
