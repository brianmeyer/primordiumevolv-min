  "output_preview": "Here are some good examples of self-evolving architectures, ranging from rewriting code to LoRA and retraining:\n* **MIT's SEAL AI**: This AI system can rewrite its own code and adapt autonomously, overcoming limits and improving its performance over time.\n* **Self-Challenging Agent (SCA)**: This AI agent alternates between generating coding problems and solving them, then fine-tunes itself using the generated data, demonstrating a self-evolving approach to improvement.\n* **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**: This method enables efficient adaptation of large language models, allowing them to evolve and improve over time by updating their parameters and architecture.\n* **Retraining**: This involves retraining AI models on new data or with new objectives, enabling them to adapt and improve their performance on specific tasks or domains.\n* **Adaptive Learning Algorithms**: These algorithms enable AI systems to continuously improve their performance and adapt to new circumstances, such as changing data distributions or user behavior.\n* **Meta-Agent Architecture**: This architecture involves AI agents responsible for creating, optimizing, and managing other AI agents, enabling self-evolution and improvement of AI systems.\n* **Self-Evolving LLM Architectures**: These architectures aim to improve the accessibility, scalability, and efficiency of large language models, enabling them to evolve and adapt over time through techniques like LoRA and retraining.\n* **OmniSense**: This is a five-layer AI-native innovation stack that acts as the decision system and memory layer for SIRP's self-evolving SOC architecture, enabling autonomous adaptation and improvement.\n* **Modular, Skill-Based AI Architecture**: This architecture involves a lightweight core model that can be extended and improved over time, enabling self-evolution and adaptation of AI systems through the addition of new skills and capabilities.\n* **Autonomous Code Generation**: This involves AI systems generating their own code, such as through the use of generative models or meta-learning algorithms, enabling self-evolution and improvement of AI systems.\n* **Dynamic Resource Allocation**: This involves AI systems allocating resources, such as compute power or memory, dynamically and autonomously, enabling self-evolution and improvement of AI systems in response to changing demands or objectives."
