  "output_preview": "* **Code Refactoring**: Self-evolving architectures can involve automated code refactoring, where the system identifies areas of improvement and rewrites the code to optimize performance, readability, or maintainability. This can be achieved through tools like automated code review and formatting.\n* **Dynamic Module Replacement**: Some self-evolving architectures allow for dynamic module replacement, where outdated or inefficient components are replaced with new ones without requiring a full system restart. This enables continuous improvement and adaptation to changing requirements.\n* **Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)**: LoRA is a technique used in large language models to adapt the model to new tasks or domains without requiring a full retraining. This involves updating a small subset of model parameters, allowing for efficient and effective adaptation to changing conditions.\n* **Transfer Learning**: Self-evolving architectures can leverage transfer learning, where a pre-trained model is fine-tuned on a new task or dataset. This enables the model to adapt to new conditions while retaining knowledge from previous experiences.\n* **Online Learning**: Online learning involves updating the model in real-time as new data arrives. This allows the system to adapt to changing conditions and improve performance over time, without requiring a full retraining.\n* **Meta-Learning**: Meta-learning involves training a model to learn how to learn from new tasks and datasets. This enables the system to adapt to new conditions and improve performance over time, without requiring a full retraining.\n* **Automated Hyperparameter Tuning**: Self-evolving architectures can involve automated hyperparameter tuning, where the system identifies optimal hyperparameters for the model and adjusts them in real-time to improve performance.\n* **Model Pruning**: Model pruning involves removing redundant or unnecessary model parameters to improve efficiency and reduce computational requirements. This can be done automatically as part of a self-evolving architecture.\n* **Knowledge Graph Updates**: Self-evolving architectures can involve updating knowledge graphs to reflect new information or changes in the domain. This enables the system to adapt to new conditions and improve performance over time.\n* **Reinforcement Learning**: Reinforcement learning involves training an agent to make decisions in a dynamic environment. This enables the system to adapt to new conditions and improve performance over time, without requiring a full retraining.\n* **Evolutionary Algorithms**: Evolutionary algorithms involve using principles of natural evolution to search for optimal solutions. This can be used in self-evolving architectures to adapt to new conditions and improve performance over time."
