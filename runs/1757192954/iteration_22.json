  "output_preview": "Here are some examples of self-evolving architectures:\n\n**Rewriting Code:**\n\n* **Microservices**: Break down monolithic architecture into smaller, independent services that can be updated and scaled individually.\n* **Serverless Architecture**: Use cloud providers to automatically provision and scale infrastructure based on demand.\n* **Function-as-a-Service (FaaS)**: Similar to serverless, but with a focus on individual functions that can be updated and scaled independently.\n\n**Auto-Scaling and Load Balancing:**\n\n* **Horizontal Scaling**: Add or remove servers as demand changes, ensuring consistent performance.\n* **Load Balancing**: Distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers to prevent overload.\n* **Auto-Scaling**: Use monitoring data to automatically scale infrastructure up or down based on demand.\n\n**Model Updates and Retraining:**\n\n* **Online Learning**: Update machine learning models in real-time as new data arrives.\n* **Incremental Learning**: Update models incrementally, rather than retraining from scratch.\n* **Transfer Learning**: Use pre-trained models as a starting point for new tasks, reducing the need for extensive retraining.\n\n**Knowledge Distillation and LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**: \n\n* **Knowledge Distillation**: Transfer knowledge from a large, complex model to a smaller, simpler one.\n* **LoRA**: Adapt a pre-trained model to a new task by modifying only a subset of its weights.\n\n**Evolutionary Computation:**\n\n* **Evolution Strategies (ES)**: Use evolutionary principles to optimize model parameters.\n* **Genetic Algorithms (GA)**: Use evolutionary principles to search for optimal solutions.\n\n**Other Techniques:**\n\n* **A/B Testing**: Run multiple versions of a system in parallel to determine which one performs better.\n* **Canary Releases**: Release new versions of a system to a small subset of users before rolling out to the entire user base.\n* **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Automate the build, test, and deployment of software to ensure quick and reliable updates."
