Darwin GÃ¶del Machine (DGM) - Phase 5 Self-Modification Scaffold

The DGM system provides a framework for systematic self-modification of the 
PrimordiumEvolv system through proposal-based evolution and canary testing.

This is a scaffold implementation with minimal functionality to establish
the architecture without affecting existing system behavior.
